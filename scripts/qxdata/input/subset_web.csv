"How AP reported in all formats from tornado-stricken regionsMarch 8, 2012
When the first serious bout of tornadoes of 2012 blew through middle America in the middle of the night, they touched down in places hours from any AP bureau. Our closest video journalist was Chicago-based Robert Ray, who dropped his plans to travel to Georgia for Super Tuesday, booked several flights to the cities closest to the strikes and headed for the airport. Heâ€™d decide once there which flight to take.
He never got on board a plane. Instead, he ended up driving toward Harrisburg, Ill., where initial reports suggested a town was destroyed. That decision turned out to be a lucky break for the AP. Twice.
Ray was among the first journalists to arrive and he confirmed those reports -- in all formats. He shot powerful video, put victims on the phone with AP Radio and played back sound to an editor who transcribed the interviews and put the material on text wires. He then walked around the devastation with the Central Regional Desk on the line, talking to victims with the phone held so close that editors could transcribe his interviews in real time.
Ray also made a dramatic image of a young girl who found a manâ€™s prosthetic leg in the rubble, propped it up next to her destroyed home and spray-painted an impromptu sign: â€œFound leg. Seriously.â€
The following day, he was back on the road and headed for Georgia and a Super Tuesday date with Newt Gingrichâ€™s campaign. The drive would take him through a stretch of the South that forecasters expected would suffer another wave of tornadoes.
To prevent running into THAT storm, Ray used his iPhone to monitor Doppler radar, zooming in on extreme cells and using Google maps to direct himself to safe routes. And then the journalist took over again.
â€œWhen weather like that occurs, a reporter must seize the opportunity to get the news out and allow people to see, hear and read the power of nature so that they can take proper shelter,â€ Ray says.
So Ray now started to use his phone to follow the storms. He attached a small GoPro camera to his steering wheel in case a tornado dropped down in front of the car somewhere, and took video of heavy rain and hail with his iPhone. Soon, he spotted a tornado and the chase was on. He followed an unmarked emergency vehicle to Cleveland, Tenn., where he was first on the scene of the storm's aftermath.
Again, the tornadoes had struck in locations that were hours from the nearest AP bureau. Damage and debris, as well as a wickedly violent storm that made travel dangerous, slowed our efforts to get to the news. That wasnâ€™t a problem in Tennessee, where our customers were well served by an all-formats report that included this text story.
â€œCLEVELAND, Tenn. (AP) _ Fierce wind, hail and rain lashed Tennessee for the second time in three days, and at least 15 people were hospitalized Friday in the Chattanooga area.â€
The byline? Robert Ray.
For being adept with technology, chasing after news as it literally dropped from the sky and setting a standard for all-formats reporting that put the AP ahead on the most competitive news story of the day, Ray wins this weekâ€™s $300 Best of the States prize.

"Did you know you have two little yellow, nine-volt-battery-sized adrenal glands in your body, just chilling out, maxinâ€™, relaxinâ€™ all cool on top of your kidneys? Someone told me this and I checked it out. Turns out itâ€™s true.
It seems as though your adrenal glands are kind of like those British Royal Guards with the big, black fuzzy hats who stand like statues in front of Buckingham Palace. They just stand there quietly, not doing much really, just enjoying the brown, slippery beach that is your kidneys.
However, if anything startling should happen that requires your attention â€” like say youâ€™re about to give a speech at a wedding or your hear a twig crack outside your tent or your doorbell rings in the middle of the night â€” then they leap into action, jumping out of their peaceful slumber to squeeze out a big dose of adrenaline right into your body, pumping you up, and turning you into a primal, warrior-like version of yourself.
When tension runs high and adrenaline is secreted into your body some crazy things can happen â€” sometimes called the fight-or-flight response:
- Your heart rate increases. And specifically, your body starts sending blood to all your big muscles and diverts it away from â€œnon-criticalâ€ parts of your body, like your brain, immune system, and digestive system. I guess someone figured you could digest the sandwich after you killed the bear.
- Your pupils dilate and you get tunnel vision. Quite literally, adrenaline also reduces your peripheral vision, which together with your big, wide pupils helps you focus on what lies ahead. You canâ€™t quite see through walls, but if a crow is diving at your eyes you might be able to swat it away better.
- Your body gets ready to boot it. In addition to the rising heart rate, your body starts turning lots more stuff into sugar, raising your blood sugar level and filling you with energy. You might not even feel pain as easily, so the raspberry bushes that shred your legs when youâ€™re running out of the forest wonâ€™t slow you down.
But whatâ€™s also great about adrenalin is that, first of all, you donâ€™t have to control it. It just sort of kicks it into high gear when it figures you could use a boost. I think itâ€™s kind of cool knowing that your body will help you out when you need it most. Punch me in the face and suddenly my internal British Royal Guard tosses away his fuzzy, black cap, cracks his neck, and rolls up his sleeves.
And really, isnâ€™t it that little dose of adrenalin that helps you do a better job when you need it most? Itâ€™s a natural upper, helping you nail the big speech, ace the final exam, or perhaps flee both of those scenes.
Thereâ€™s a reason some people become adrenaline junkies. The boost you get from your adrenal glands waking up and getting out of bed is intoxicating. Sure, it fuzzes up your thinking a bit and sends your intestines on sabbatical, but it sure does pump you up. And remember: when something important in your life is about to happen, you can count on your good pal adrenaline to be there, juicing you up, helping you fight the good fight.
Jian Ghomeshi is the host of my favorite radio show. Itâ€™s called Q and broadcasts across North America every morning. Jian is a big friend and fan of 1000 Awesome Things and The Book of Awesome and Iâ€™m really excited because he just released his first book. Itâ€™s called 1982 and is a beautifully written memoir about growing up in the suburbs of Toronto and trying to fit in. (My kind of book!)

"Five Reasons I Love Boston
1. The water.
The Atlantic Ocean, as deep and true as denim, so blue it melts into the sky, horizonless. And the Charles River. Years from now, Iâ€™ll remember riding the Red Line from Boston into Cambridge at night â€“ the way the lights streak across the black water like crayons lined up in a box.
After my childhood in Seattle to my college years in Boston, I donâ€™t think I could live anywhere but a coast.
2. The seasons.
I always come back to school right at the tail end of summer. Heat sinks into the subway stations like poisonous gas, and whatever you wear, itâ€™s too much fabric. With October right around the corner, though, fall settles in. I love the way golden light fans out from behind buildings and through alleyways. Yellow leaves get stuck in the rain currents along the sidewalk. Itâ€™s my favorite time of year.
Boston has also taught me the true meaning of winter. Winter is wet hair freezing solid on the way to class, two pairs of socks, ears tucked into scarves. Torrential flurries of snowflakes that burn skin. Frankly, winter is miserable.
But then thereâ€™s that one morning â€“ and itâ€™s always a morning, and youâ€™re never quite prepared for it â€“ when you step outside and every tree in Boston has bloomed. Cherry blossoms opened like pale pink popcorn, blue skies, tender green leaves. Itâ€™s such a miracle that this can happen despite the sheets of ice and crazy wind tunnels, it makes everything worthwhile.
3. The quirkiness.
I love the farmerâ€™s markets all over the city, the narrow brick alleys begging to be explored, the late night restaurants in Chinatown. Boston constantly surprises me. Today I discovered the food trucks â€“ why didnâ€™t I know that Boston has food trucks??
4. The history.
A handful of the founding fathers are buried mere blocks from campus. I walk through the oldest park in America to get to my boyfriend D-â€™s apartment in Beacon Hill, a neighborhood of gas lamps and weathered brick. Everywhere you look, historic churches stand between skyscrapers. The contrast is astonishing.
5. These amazing people.
Sure, most of them arenâ€™t from Boston. A-â€™s from Colorado, C-â€™s from LA, and S- is all the way from Guam. But nine months of the year, theyâ€™re all mine. They make Boston feel like home.

"TRIBE CHIEF TRIS DAZZLES AT DISH, FLUBS IN FIELD IN SIXTH STRAIGHT TIGER WIN
By Calvin J. Butterworth
June 19, 1924
Ty Cobb can tell you. Personally causing your team's loss when you are managing said team can be a devastating turn of events. Players who look to you for leadership and support are left in a rudderless abyss and often need to find dry morning land on their own.
Such was the case at Navin Field today, as the suddenly resurgent Indians re-visited our neighborhood, fresh from taking three of four from the Yankees and before that, four straight from Boston. It was their misfortune, though, to run into the Earl of Whitehill, who has been spinning masterpieces of hurling lately. Skipper Speaker doubled off him with two outs in the 1st, but Riggs Stephenson, back from an ailment, left him there with a short fly. Joe Sewell and Speaker singled with two outs again two innings later, but this time Riggs grounded out.
Meanwhile Harry Heilman, hero of yesterday, was stranding runners aplenty for our side, failing after three straight Fred Haney hits off Joe Shaute. The game remained scoreless through the first six frames, a remarkable achievement when one considers the power of these clubs' collective clout.
With one out in the Tiger 7th, though, Frank O'Rourke reached on his third single. Whitehill then lofted a fly straight out to Speaker. The sun had been playing peek-and-seek all afternoon behind thin clouds, and as the ball reached its pinnacle it was evident Tris was having trouble locating it. Sure enough, he threw up his mitt at the last moment and was as stunned as the thousands of witnesses were to have it nick off the top and bound insanely toward the deep fence. By the time he tracked down the sphere, O'Rourke had scampered home and Whitehill was standing on third base. Shaute was visibly unnerved, threw a muffin-ball to Rigney, and Topper rammed it into the corner for a double and 2-0 lead!
Egg still dripping down his face, Speaker singled with one out in the 8th, Stephenson followed with one of his own, but the Earl induced a twin killing off the bat of George Burns to end the threat. Another minor disturbance went by the wayside in the 9th, Whitehill had his tidy 10-hit shutout, and Detroit had won six games in a row.
Cobb was thrilled later about the result. ""Home runs? Who needs 'em? We got more line hits in our bureau than a buccaneer's got dubloons in the sand."" Someone mentioned the error by Speaker was a lucky break and Cobb froze the reporter with a baleful stare before ducking into the nearest shower stall.
CLE 000 000 000 - 0 10 1
DET 000 000 20x - 2 8 0
Only other American League game today:
at BROWNS 10-14-0, WHITE SOX 8-10-2
One of the more thrilling spectacles of this or any year, and no one expected it. The Chicagos have had their way with St. Louis all season, and with Sloppy Thurston staked to a 6-2 after three on the horrific Ray Kolp, Brownie fans were already making their dinner plans. It was actually 8-2 in the last of the 6th when four Browns singles and a key flub from Bill Barrett gave St. Louis four runs and put them back in the contest. A Pat Collins single in the 8th pulled them to 8-7, as great relief twirling from George Grant and Hub Pruett kept matters close. But after Tobin and pinch-hitter Severeid both singled to begin the last of the 9th, up stepped famous batsman George Sisler. He picked out a Thurston curve, swung mightily and cracked it on a magnificent arc out to right. Hooper gave chase but ran out of room as the ball dropped into the Sportsman Park pavilion amidst a gaggle of celebrating fans.
Washington will be in Shibe Park tomorrow, now with a 2-game advantage, while the Red Sox will take their losing streak into Yankee Stadium.

"|Tommy Pi - Trance Experience|
|Written by Paul|
Tommy Pi started DJing at small private parties at the age of 13. He was always into music, so it was no surprise when he went on and bought his first equipment, some Omnictronic Turntables and a small Gemini mixer. From that day on he always used any chance he got to play at parties, and it wasn't long before his day would come, for him play on a big stage in front of more than 50 people! There was a big party in his home town of Minden (North Germany) with DJ's like Monika Kruse, Alex LÃ¼ck and others and Tommy thought that it would be great to play there. So he went straight to the promotor and said 'Hey man, I'm from here, I'm a DJ, too so can I play?'Not thinking that this would ever be possible, the promotor said, 'Ok, just come here tomorrow, and you can play for an hour'. That was the birth of DJ Tommy Pi.
From then on, Tommy played in clubs like PW1 in Porta Westfalica, or Go!Parc in Herford. He also played the Go!Parc on Tour Events alongside Alex LÃ¼ck and others. The biggest day was yet to come! On 21st of October 2000 Tommy and his mate Dee-B had the chance to play alongside Piet Blank at the Einslive Party in Minden, invited by Piet himself. It was a big party and Tommy was very nervous and shaking as he put the needle on the vinyl for the first record 'DJ Culture'. He played on that evening and the crowd were fantastic and it was a lot of fun for both, Tommy and Dennis.
The crowning Glory for Tommy was in 2002 when he was voted as 'Best DJ' by the local magazine 'StadtgeflÃ¼ster'. Tommy was the second DJ to win this trophy, after Timo Maas won it the year before.
In 2003 Tommy started his weekly Radio Show 'Trance Experience' on PureDJ. The show is streamed every Monday from 8-10 pm CET. Now, 1Mix is rebroadcasting the show from October 2008 Tuesdays from 4-6pm.
In February 2005 Tommy's second Radio Show 'Trance Experience ETN Edition' was started on ETN.fm as a monthly one-hour radio show.
All of Tommy's mixes and Radio Shows are now available as a Podcast on iTunes,podcast.de or mypodcast.com.",<urn:uuid:7e6216ca-0a01-498d-85f7-7d4aed299c98>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://1mix.co.uk/trance-shows/tommy-pi-trance-experience.html,2013-05-18T05:54:17Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.985656917,527,,,,,
"When I found out we would be getting a PopATot for review I was excited! I knew before we even had it that we would like it, but I had no idea how much we would LOVE it! I am so excited to share this amazing product with you all!
PopATot was created by parents, Evan and Stacy, who have 5 children! I personally think this idea is wonderful. When I was trying to describe to my husband what was coming in the mail for Ladybug, I described it as a cross between a card table, an exersaucer, and a fabric folding chair. He sort of got it, but when he finally saw it he totally understood my references!!!
I will let our many photos of Ladybug speak mostly for themselves (she is 5 1/2-6 months in all of these photos). We use this thing every day now, and in many different places throughout each day-it is that easy to move around.
My absolute favorite use for the PopATot is in our schoolroom. We have a fairly small schoolroom and I only need to have Ladybug in there sometimes, so I don't want a big baby item in there. PopATot is perfect because I can set it up and take it down quickly!
My bedroom is another of those places! She hangs out in my room often like this now!!
We have a 2nd story deck off of our bedroom, and the PopATot is perfect for the deck!!! We can't fit anything else out the small door, let alone leave something big out there in the weather. This is wonderful!
I set Ladybug up in the middle and the boys ride all around her on their riding toys!
She's all smiles and cuteness!!!
Pac Man likes the PopATot too ;)
I am so excited that one of YOU is going to win this awesome baby item, just in time for the holiday season. Won't this be wonderful to have for Thanksgiving or Christmas, when you are away from home? I am looking forward to bringing ours with us to visit family for Christmas this year! It folds up so small and fits in it's own sling bag so it is very portable!

"Iranâ€™s Wild Card for Defense Stocks In 2012 â€¦ Dividends Hang in the Balance (ATK, GD, LLL, LMT, RTN)December 28, 2011 by Jon C. Ogg
It is no secret that Iran is a saber-rattling nation. The country wants to be relevant on the global stage so much that it keeps up with its nuclear ambitions regardless of global trading sanctions and regardless of efforts from the Western nations trying to stop it. And now the big news is not the nuclear front, but an Iranian minister claiming that Iran could effectively block the flow of traffic through the Gulf of Hormuz easier than drinking a glass of water.
In the age of austerity and military budgets being slashed to deal with deficits, Iran has a chance of turning 2012 accidentally into the year of defense stocks. Alliant Techsystems Inc. (NYSE: ATK), General Dynamics Corp. (NYSE: GD), L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (NYSE: LLL), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) and Raytheon Co. (NYSE: RTN) could all hang in the balance. With operations all but gone in Iraq and with the trend in Afghanistan being one of leaving, Iran is the obvious wild card.
If anything real ever comes out of Iranâ€™s religious political leadership other than how neat it is to stone people over adultery, how it denies that alternative lifestyles exist in Iran, or about how it wants nuclear power for peace, this may end up making the sell-off seen in defense stocks a bargain of the century. If (or when) Iran ever announces that it has built a nuclear bomb, it likely is going to be difficult for Western nations to slash and burn too far on the defense spending. Before running out and loading up on warfare stocks, please remember â€¦ this is all â€œIf, Then.â€
Alliant Techsystems Inc. (NYSE: ATK) trades at $56.15 and the 52-week trading range is $51.26 to $78.17. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $71.70, implying upside of roughly 28%. Alliant Tech currently has a lower dividend yield against peers with only a payout rate of about 1.4% and shares are up about 4% since the Thanksgiving break. Alliant is highly dependent on the business of selling bullets and it no longer has the booster-rocket business from Space Shuttle launches.
General Dynamics Corp. (NYSE: GD) trades at $66.15 and the 52-week trading range is $53.95 to $78.27. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $76.16, implying upside of about 15%. General Dynamics currently yields about 2.9%.
L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (NYSE: LLL) trades at $66.85 and the 52-week trading range is $58.30 to $88.55. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $71.64, implying upside of only about 7%. L-3 yields about 2.7% in its dividend and shares are up about 5% from the Thanksgiving break.
Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) trades at $81.25 and the 52-week trading range is $66.36 to $82.43. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $80.12, implying that the stock is above a full-value price. Its dividend yield is quite high at about 5% and shares are up almost 5% since its $1.00 dividend was reflected in the stock in late November.
Raytheon Co. (NYSE: RTN) trades at $48.50 and the 52-week trading range is $38.35 to $53.12. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $49.53, implying upside of only about 2%. Its dividend yield is currently about 3.7% and shares are up about 14% since the Thanksgiving break.
Unless something new comes out of North Korea, or unless there is more unrest in the Middle East, Iran is the big worry for the country today. With such high payouts from some defense contractors, it is worth wondering just how high some of the payouts can rise during the proliferation of austerity.

"San Francisco 49ers cornerback Shawntae Spencer will miss the rest of the season with a torn ligament in his left knee.
Spencer, a fifth-year pro, will be placed on injured reserve soon after undergoing surgery Wednesday to repair the ligament. He injured his knee late in the 49ersâ€™ road victory at Seattle on Sept. 14, and missed last weekâ€™s victory over Detroit.
Tarell Brown and Donald Strickland will compete to replace Spencer with the 49ers, who kept 12 defensive backs on their 53-man roster to start the season. Brown, a second-year pro, got his first career interception last weekend while filling in for Strickland, who also sat out with a knee injury.",<urn:uuid:100d293c-7eea-4a56-93ef-88c64b25a9a2>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://49ersnews.com/2008/09/spencer-done/,2013-05-18T06:20:38Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.961928725,153,,,,,
"In Suzanne Collinsâ€™s wildly popular Hunger Games books, children are chosen by lottery to serve as gladiators who fight to the death. The Games are televised for the entertainment of the general population. Collins models her games on ancient Rome, where gladiators fought to the death and slaves were fed to the lions. She even names her dystopian world Panem, after the Latin word for bread, as in bread and circuses, panem et circenses. Bread and circuses refers to the cheap trick of persuading the masses to cheer for a lion or a slave, for one gladiator or another, rather than participating in or observing or acting to change the political arena. Keep the general population fed with the most basic of food and keep their minds off of rebellion with the distractions of entertainment.
As I read through Lenore Skenazyâ€™s blog and watched her appearances on various chat shows, I kept thinking, â€œBread and circuses.â€ There is so much air time to fill, so television producers and headline writers make news of the Mommy Wars. Free Range Parenting vs. Helicopter Parenting. Stay-at-home Mothers vs. Working Mothers. Breast vs. Bottle. Sleep Training vs. Attachment Parenting. Blah, blah, blah. In one bloggerâ€™s take on the issue, she asks, â€œFree range parenting versus helicopter parenting: which team are YOU on?â€ Really? We have to pick teams? These issues are so much more complex than x vs. y, but so much easier to digest if packaged in a familiar us vs. them format.
In one clip, Skenazy and another parent appear on Anderson Cooper to replay how Skenazy was able to help this woman who is so much of the helicopter persuasion that in public washrooms she feels it necessary to go right into the bathroom stall with her daughter. â€œDoesnâ€™t everybody?â€ this mother quips, when the audience gasps. They feed this woman to the lions, then they rescue her, undo her public shame with a public reformation of her extreme and errant ways.
Unless itâ€™s extreme, itâ€™s not entertainment, so we have thown up on the screen all kind of wild and wacky folk on reality shows who hoard or dumpster dive for coupons for hundreds of free sticks of deodorant, saving up against Armageddon.
What good does any of this do? Silly distractions from the reality lived in the murky middle ground.
I respect Skenazy and her husbandâ€™s decision to let their son ride the subway alone. I respect her desire to move away from a culture where kids are kept bubble wrapped. I respect her initiative to create a television show that capitalizes on the buzz that her sonâ€™s subway ride generated. But I resent the circus atmosphere of telling the stories of bubble wrapped or free range kids.
Why do mothers keep feeding each other to the lion of artificially polarized public opinion?",<urn:uuid:1ac6d51e-62f3-46ac-b505-0adc65876218>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://4mothers1blog.com/2012/04/24/a-big-silly-distraction/,2013-05-18T06:19:05Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.937657773,620,,,,,

"(Fort Worth, TX) On Sunday, March 4th, The 5Choir from Saint Andrew Catholic Church in Fort Worth appeared at the 2012 Spirit Games at Nolan Catholic High School. The Stephen Breen Memorial Foundation brought together Fort Worth's Catholic kids of all ages for the fifth annual SPIRIT GAMES, a day of competition and fun. The Stephen Breen Memorial Foundation is committed to offering financial aid to local children who seek the strength and values of a Catholic education and to those courageous children and their families whose lives are afflicted with cancer.
The 5Choir played and sang for the Mass with Bishop Kevin Vann, and played a short set of songs after Mass. The band covered songs featured on local Christian station KLTY, such as ""Your Grace is Enough"" and ""The Revelation Song"" as well as Catholic favorites like ""Here I Am, Lord"". For the Ordinary of the Mass, they played selections from the new Mass of St. Frances Cabrini by Kevin Keil, director of Liturgy and Music at Holy Cross Catholic Church in The Colony.
The members of the 5Choir are: Jed Chatterton, Mike Hyry & John Costlow, guitars; Gerard Bowsher, drums; Brian Benison, bass, keyboards and director; Athena Meyer, flute, keyboard & vocals and David Lyles, Victor Meyer, Honey Rae, Aimee Pietzsch, Peggy Spears, Mark Trance & Kimberly Ward, vocals. Sound at the Spirit Games by Opie Odom.
Asked about the 2012 Spirit Games, 5Choir director Brian said, ""I was thrilled when Jim Breen, President of The [Stephen Breen Memorial] Foundation called and asked if the 5Choir could play at the Spirit Games. Jim heard us play at the 5PM Mass at Saint Andrew and thought we were a good fit. I have been working with the 5Choir for 2 years, and everyone in the group is fantastic and full of enthusiasm for this musical outreach. Can't wait to do it again!""

"Residents Oppose Rezoning to Make Way for Walmart
Itâ€™s no secret the Bentonville-based retail behemoth would love to put a Walmart store of some sort in Bella Vista, as it continues to scour the country for more real estate amid a very saturated landscape.
But several Bella Vista residents in the chosen neighborhood oppose the rezoning of 6.4 acres of residential and surrounding woodlands which would become eligible for commercial use by Walmart.
Walmart has a pending contract to purchase the corner lot at Oldham Drive and U.S. 71 which is already zoned commercial, but the deal is contingent on the Bella Vista City Council approving a motion to re-zone 6.4 acres of woodland behind the narrow frontage lots.

"Banks To Start Adding Debit Card Fees; Bank of America and More
Starting soon, maybe as soon as tomorrow, if youâ€™re like me and use your debit card to buy everything from gum to groceries to video games, you may have to pay a monthly fee for the convenience of not carrying cash everywhere.
Albeit not much, five dollars, thatâ€™s five more dollars that we never used to have to spend just to put our money in a bank. I first heard about Bank of America doing this yesterday, but now Iâ€™m learning that other banks like Chase and Wells Fargo may be doing it as well. Not that Iâ€™m surprised. A lot of national chain banks are starting to have fees for just about everything else you do.
Hereâ€™s what the New York Times said on this:
Bank of America joins banks including SunTrust and Regions in charging the fees. Other institutions, like Wells Fargo and Chase, are testing them, too. And over all, bank fees have crept up to record levels, a recent survey found.
The added fees have come even though the limit on the merchant fees wasnâ€™t as low as banks initially had feared. (The Federal Reserve originally considered a cap of 12 cents, or half of what it finally set.)
Looks like I may be back to carrying cash on me once again. How about you? Tell us what you think in the comments below.

"Insurance Company Declares Living Man Dead
George Johannesen is very much alive. Which is why it was so surprising when the Canadian man received a letter addressed â€œTo the Estate of George Johannesen.â€ Even more surprising is that it came from his insurance company, who should really be on top of such things.
Now this wouldnâ€™t have been so terrible if Manitoba Public Insurance was giving Johannesenâ€™s estate a fat check for his passing away. But thatâ€™s not what happened. Instead the letter was to inform the estate that, since George was dead, his driver license and auto insurance had been cancelled in October.
This poses a problem for Johannesen because, being alive, he continues to drive his car.
â€œI donâ€™t understand how this could have happened,â€ he told the Toronto Sun. â€œFor me to be declared dead, someone would have to present a death certificate. For someone to get that, I guess I must have died sometime in October.â€
Now the 59-year-old worries that he will stop getting his pension and other government benefits. The Manitoba Public Insurance Company says they are trying to resolve the issue. They also claim they werenâ€™t the ones who determined Johannesen was dead, but cryptically canâ€™t reveal the source of the confusion for confidentially reasons.

Last yearâ€™s R+L Carriers New Orleans Bowl set a new attendance record, due in no small part to the more than 18.000 Cajuns fans who purchased tickets through the UL athletics department.
This year, another record could easily be set.
It was announced today over 20,000 tickets have been sold through the UL ticket office, with ticket sales continuing throughout the weekend. The box office is open 10am-6pm Monday through Friday.
Monday at 6pm is the deadline to buy tickets at the UL ticket office.
The increased ticket sales has led NO Bowl officials to open the Terrace level to the Mercedes Benz Superdome for the first time in bowl history.

"40th Parliament, 3rd Session
March 3, 2010 -
March 26, 2011
About this Committee
Like other standing committees, the Standing Committee on Health is appointed under the Standing Orders of the House of Commons for the life of a specific Parliament. It was first established in this form in 1994 to reflect the fact that the Department of Health and Welfare had been separated into two components: Health and Human Resources Development. By November 1995, this departmental restructuring was formally recognized in Bill C-95 (Department of Health Act).
The House of Commons Standing Committee on Health is empowered to study and report on all matters relating to the mandate, management, and operation of Health Canada. This includes its responsibilities for the operations of the internal body called the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA).
The Committee is also responsible for the oversight of five agencies that report to Parliament through the Minister of Health:
- Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR);
- Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB);
- Hazardous Materials Information Review Commission (HMIRC);
- Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC);
- Assisted Human Reproduction Canada (AHRC)
The mandate of the Standing Committee on Health also includes reviewing and reporting on matters referred to it by Orders of Reference from the House of Commons relating to Health Canada and its associated agencies.",<urn:uuid:d3966269-01e6-4b57-94f8-f40e83294d91>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://Ignatieff.M@parl.gc.ca/CommitteeBusiness/AboutCommittees.aspx?Cmte=HESA&Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=40&Ses=3,2013-05-18T06:50:06Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.947483599,278,,,,,

It is a frequently encountered problem that new knowledge arrived when making decisions in a dynamic world. Usually, domain experts cannot afford enough time and knowledge to effectively assess and combine both qualitative and quantitative information in these models.Existing approaches can solve only one of two tasks instead of both.We propose a four-step algorithm to integrate multiple probabilistic graphic models, which can effectively update existing models with newly acquired models. In this algorithm, the qualitative part of model integration is performed first, followed by the quantitative combination. We illustrate our method with an example of combining three models. We also identify the factors that may influence the complexity of the integrated model. Accordingly, we identify three factors that may influence the complexity of the integrated model. Accordingly, we present three heuristic methods of target variable ordering generation. Such methods show their feasibility through our experiments and are good in different situations. Finally, we provide some comments based on our experiments results.",<urn:uuid:f20540ee-fafb-422d-9d76-a6fc554293b7>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Spring/2005/ss05-02-009.php,2013-05-18T08:02:49Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.928985059,209,,,,,

Parents are usually the first to recognize that their child has a problem with emotions or behavior. Still, the decision to seek professional help can be difficult and painful for a parent. The first step is to gently try to talk to the child. An honest open talk about feelings can often help. Parents may choose to consult with the child's physicians, teachers, members of the clergy, or other adults who know the child well. These steps may resolve the problems for the child and family.
Following are a few signs which may indicate that a child and adolescent psychiatric evaluation will be useful.
- Marked fall in school performance
- Poor grades in school despite trying very hard
- Severe worry or anxiety, as shown by regular refusal to go to school, go to sleep or take part in activities that are normal for the child's age
- Frequent physical complaints
- Hyperactivity; fidgeting; constant movement beyond regular playing with or without difficulty paying attention
- Persistent nightmares
- Persistent disobedience or aggression (longer than 6 months) and provocative opposition to authority figures
- Frequent, unexplainable temper tantrums
- Threatens to harm or kill oneself
- Marked decline in school performance
- Inability to cope with problems and daily activities
- Marked changes in sleeping and/or eating habits
- Extreme difficulties in concentrating that get in the way at school or at home

"According to reports, Mr Jammeh recently told supporters he would â€œcut off the headâ€ of any homosexual caught in the Gambia.
1. The Gambia is ruled by President Yahya Jammeh, an army officer who seized power in 1994.
In the past, he has also claimed he could cure anyone with the Aids virus in three days.
2. A British couple who have spent the past 12 years working as Christian missionaries in the the Gambia have been jailed after being charged with sedition. (British missionaries jailed in Gambia )

3. Scary Tales of Tiny Gambia Being the Headquarters of the Mafia World
By Bubacarr Ceesay
December 13, 2005
The Gambia is the international limelight again as the center of an international mafia ring.
In a masterpiece investigative report, The Wayne Madsen Report unraveled a network of weapons smugglers and mobsters operating in the heart of the Gambian Capital, working hand in hand with the Gambian leader, President Yahya Jammeh.
In reference to the Gambia, the report stated thus:
""There is also now interest in the activities of Richard T. Hines, the head of the powerful Republican lobbying firm RTH Consulting, Inc.
""Hines, a South Carolina native and a protege of the late GOP dirty trickmeister Lee Atwater, was one of the architects of the dirty tricks campaign by Bush against John McCain in the 2000 South Carolina primary.
""A confederate of Abramoff in the 1980s Reagan administration's covert support network for the Nicaraguan contras, Angolan UNITA guerrillas, and Afghan mujaheddin, Hines is active in various Confederacy resurgence organizations, many of which have clear racist agendas.
""However, that has not prevented Hines from becoming the lobbyist for Gambian dictator Yahya Jammeh, a military officer who overthrew Gambia's democratically-elected President Sir Dawda K. Jawara in a 1994 military coup supported by the United States Navy.
""Hines inherited the lobbying contract for Gambia from the eclectic Washington lobbyist Edward von Kloberg III, an individual who represented Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, Liberia's Samuel K. Doe, Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania, Congolese leader Laurent Kabila, the exiled King Kigeli V of Rwanda, and Saddam Hussein.
""Last May, von Kloberg took a swan dive off of a castle in Rome, allegedly committing suicide after a spat with a gay partner.
""The connections between Hines and Gambia are important since the small narrow West African country is also a major base of operations for notorious Russian international arms smuggler Viktor Bout.
""The Gambia is the headquarters for one of many of Bout's front companies -- companies that are used to smuggle everything from weapons to diamonds and mercenaries to international relief supplies.
Bout, reportedly in a Bangkok jail since March 2008
""In fact, Bout was the character on whom fictional arms smuggler Yuri Orlov, played by Nicolas Cage in the movie Lord of War, was largely based.
""Bout's connections with the Christian Right do not end with Gambia.
""Bout was Liberian dictator Charles Taylor's primary arms and diamond smuggler.
""Bout and his associates were given Liberian diplomatic passports and, with Taylor's blessing and protection, they registered a number of their front companies in Monrovia, the Liberian capital.
""Taylor, who is now in exile in Nigeria, was a business partner with Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson.
""Robertson's organization mentored both Ralph Reed and Richard Hines.
""According to British and Israeli intelligence sources, Taylor also enabled Al Qaeda to launder blood diamonds for cash through Liberia.
""Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone were where Israeli mobsters engaged in business with Israeli gangsters who operated under the full protection of the Israeli Likud government.
""Before Likud began purging Mossad of experienced intelligence officers with ties to the Israeli Labor Party, the Israeli-Al Qaeda diamond financial connection in West Africa was being pointed out by those officers as suicidal for Israeli interests.
""However, Taylor and Bout had powerful interests in the United States: a combination of the Christian Right and pro-Likud organizations like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), both of which ignored and continue to ignore Israeli organized crime connections to Al Qaeda and terrorism.
""Robertson and Taylor were business partners in a Cayman Islands front company called Freedom Gold, Ltd.
""In fact, Freedom Gold bas headquartered at Robertson's CBN offices in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Robertson's African interests also crossed paths with Bout's in another country -- the former Zaire.
""Robertson's African Development Company used the cover of Robertson's tax-exempt ""Operation Blessing"" to ferry conflict diamonds out of civil war-ravaged Zaire (now Congo).
""A UN Security Council report dated November 30, 2005, lists Bout's Gambia New Millennium Air Company as having its address at the residence of Hines' client Jammeh: State House, Banjul, Gambia.
""The UN report states, 'The Director of this firm is Baba Jobe, who is already listed on the Liberia Sanctions Committee's assets freeze list. According to a commercial aviation database, the firm acted as a cover for Victor Bout's operations. Its one aircraft, a Russian-made passenger jet, was acquired from Centrafrican Airlines.'
""It is noteworthy that Hines's client, President Jammeh, just took possession of the Russian-made VIP presidential passenger jet, an Ilyushin IL-62 (C5-GNM) [Gambia] (formerly CCCP-86511 [USSR], RA-86511 [Russia], 3D-RTI [Swaziland], TL-ACL [Central African Republic]).
""And also of interest is the owner of the presidential aircraft: it is none other than Gambia New Millennium Air, the Bout-owned company listed on the UN Security Council freeze list and which is headquartered at Jammeh's State House in Banjul, the Gambian capital.
""In fact, the plane had been previously registered to Bout front companies in Swaziland and the Central African Republic.
"" Bout, who flew arms and passengers from Dubai and other locations to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan prior to 9-11, is now providing air services in post-Taliban Afghanistan as well as U.S.-occupied Iraq.
""Bout's transactions with the Taliban were handled by Vial, Inc., a firm based in Delaware.
""One of Bout's closest associates is the Russian-Israeli Odessa-born crime boss Leonid Minin, an Israeli national who, according to the UN Security Council, travels on forged German passports as well as legal Israeli, Russian, Greek, and Bolivian passports under at least ten aliases.
""It is also noteworthy that many of Bout's operations are based in Eastern European countries that have been mentioned in association with the rendition and transporting of CIA prisoners.
""Bout's numerous Russian-built cargo and passenger planes have been seen at the same airports used by CIA flights.
""For example, Bright Aviation, a suspected Bout front, is based at Sofia Airport in Bulgaria.
""Bulgaria is believed to be one of the countries used by the CIA to house secret prisoners.
""Another Bout front, Moldtransavia SRL, is based in Chisinau, Moldova, another suspected stopover point for CIA flights.
""One Chisinau, Moldova-based Bout front company, Aerocom, which also does business as Air Mero, is contracted to fly for Kellogg, Brown & Root in Iraq and elsewhere.
""Aerocom has also been cited in UN and DEA reports for being involved in drug smuggling in Belize.
""Some law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe believe that the covert flights being operated by CIA contractors and Bout's companies in support of secret prisoner movement are also involved in smuggling drugs.
""After being subjected to news reports, Aerocom quickly changed its name last year.""
Highly dependable sources in Banjul also informed AllGambian about recent arms purchase by the Jammeh regime from an undisclosed country, amounting to 4.3 million dalasis.
This comes at the heels of a hard-hitting border impasse between the Gambia and Senegal.
The stand-off almost paralyzed the Gambian economy and caused untold hardship on the average Gambian. Observers wondered how the Gambia gov can afford to spend on presidential jets and military hardware at this junction when the economy is in shambles.",<urn:uuid:052280ae-4e57-401f-95a0-23a58b01b11a>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://aangirfan.blogspot.ca/2008/12/gambia-and-organised-crime.html,2013-05-18T07:19:30Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.947874784,1848,,,,,

Session 40 - The Interstellar Medium.
Display session, Tuesday, June 09
Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) explosions can make kpc-size shells and holes in the interstellar media (ISM) of spiral galaxies if much of the energy heats the local gas to above 10^7 K. Disk blowout is probably the major cause for energy loss in this case, but the momentum acquired during the pressurized expansion phase can be large enough that the bubble still snowplows to a kpc diameter. This differs from the standard model for the origin of such shells by multiple supernovae, which may have problems with radiative cooling, evaporative losses, and disk blow-out. Evidence for giant shells with energies of \sim10^53 ergs are summarized. Some contain no obvious central star clusters and may be GRB remnants, although sufficiently old clusters would be hard to detect. The expected frequency of GRBs in normal galaxies can account for the number of such shells.

"Everyone wishes for something. And lots of people believe they know how to make their wishes come true with magical thinking.
What is it? ""Magical thinking is a belief in forms of causation, with no known physical basis,"" said Professor Emily Pronin of Princeton. ""So, for example, there's no known physical basis for how carrying a fluffy pink rabbit's foot in your pocket is going to increase your odds of winning the lottery.""
For magical thinkers, it's more about the power of their wishes, their feelings and their positive thinking to affect their lives directly.
Twenty-seven-year-old aspiring actress Lindsay Lioz relies on magical thinking to further her showbiz career -- starting with visualizing every audition in advance. ""It makes me feel like I've had rehearsal,"" she said. ""It makes me feel prepared.""
Lioz also uses magical thinking to improve her love life. She's written a list of the qualities she wants in a man -- and she sleeps with that list under her pillow every night. How has it worked so far? ""I have great men in my life, I do. I'm very happy with how it's working out.""
Magical thinkers call that idea ""the law of attraction."" It's a key element of the bestselling book ""The Secret,"" which has been hailed by Oprah Winfrey and bought by millions worldwide.
""'The Secret' is telling people that if you think positive thoughts, positive things will happen, even at a very specific level,"" Pronin said. ""If you visualize getting a parking space, you will get one. If you want to get thin, just stop having fat thoughts.""
Magical thinking is not a religion. It's a different kind of faith -- a faith in the power of positive thoughts and feelings. Yet as unscientific as magical thinking sounds, Pronin said studies have shown there are times when it seems to have a real effect: ""There was a study where people in their mid-20s were measured in terms of their optimism,"" she said, ""and then, 50 years later, those who were more optimistic, were actually more likely to still be alive. So it's not always magical to believe that your positive thoughts are having a positive effect.""
Magical thinking starts in childhood. At the University of Texas, Professor Jacqui Woolley has examined how children who know the difference between what's real and what's not believe that wishing can cause a penny to appear in what has just been shown to be an empty box. ""We find that, by about the age of 4, most of the kids we test seem to really believe that wishing works,"" said Woolley. ""So that would be an example of magical thinking.""
Nick Barber spent his childhood wishing for riches, focusing on something his father gave him. ""I was about 8 or 9 when my dad came home and gave me a fake million dollar bill,"" he said. ""And that became something that represented my goals. I've hung on to it every since.""
Barber would even sleep with the bill under his mattress. Now, at 27, he runs a multimillion dollar real estate company in Dallas called UMoveFree, and he still has that million dollar bill in his wallet. How did that bill help him get to this point? ""It allowed me to believe in myself at a very young age,"" Barber said, ""not to pay attention to those that said you can't, and to always believe that I can.""",<urn:uuid:97684525-19c7-48da-a302-c2da701993dd>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=3160862&page=1,2013-05-18T07:15:02Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.990036845,716,,,,,
"Do you drive a picop? Eat sÃ¡ndwiches de rosbif? Do you still own any cederrones? If these words don't sound familiar to you, that's because yesterday, the Associated Press released their first-ever Spanish language style guide, and set us all straight on the proper usage of some of EspaÃ±ol's newest words.
In case there's any confusion, picop is AP's official Spanish-language word for what many call a camioneta or pick-up truck, rosbif is their official spelling for ""roast beef"" in Spanish. And cederrÃ³n? That means CD-ROM. Duh.
Gathered in the auditorium of the prestigious Columbia Journalism School, some of the leading Spanish-language journalists sat down on Monday evening to discuss the finer points of the ""language of Cervantes"" and the AP stylebook -- which they describe as the ""journalist's bible."" Debate over the AP's continued use of term ""illegal immigrant"" dominated much of the event. But the most lively part of the evening was the presentation of words with roots in modern-day English -- or ""estadunidismos,"" as the new Stylebook calls them.
If the Spanish-language style guide is to be our bible, then Monday evening's Moses was surely Argentine journalist Jorge Ignacio Covarrubias who has worked with the AP for more than 40 years and helped put together the new stylebook. The white-haired Covarrubias handed down to us such words as zapeo for channel surfing, cibersitio for website, pipermÃ­n for peppermint, ofimÃ¡tica for computer system for office management (like Word), and vermÃº for vermouth -- all in the form of a PowerPoint presentation. (Can we please call it a PowerrpoÃ­n?)
But not all Spanglish words are fair game, according to Covarrubias. For example, the AP recommends against using parada to mean parade. The word ""parada"" has historically been used to mean ""stop"", but many modern-day Spanish speakers have started using it to also mean parade. The AP suggests that writers instead use ""desfile.""
Many regionalisms are also discouraged. AutobÃºs is the preferred term for bus, although some countries use guagua and others say colectivo. But, after lengthy discussion of the Spanish word for ""drinking straw,"" (pajita vs. popote vs. canuto), no consensus has yet been reached, said Covarrubias.
Not everybody was happy about all of the AP's decisions. Laura MartÃ­nez, a bilingual blogger who writes about Hispanic media, tweeted ""Cervantes is probably revolcÃ¡ndose en la tumba tras escuchar el tema Ã©se del ""cederrÃ³n"","" which translates to ""Cervantes is probably turning over in his grave after hearing the thing about the 'cederrÃ³n'""",<urn:uuid:cd3169e8-c0b9-4e0a-9e29-ee6c8330ed11>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/ap-spanish-language-stylebook-introduces-technical-spanglish/story?id=17769035,2013-05-18T06:21:24Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.921005309,619,,,,,
"The recent news that Bristol Palin and Levi Johnston were engaged came as a shock to many.
After all, here's a couple whose relationship imploded on the world stage and turned into a bitter family feud involving Palin's mother Sarah Palin, the former vice presidential candidate.
Following their breakup, the pair traveled very different paths: Bristol Palin went on to be a spokeswoman for teen abstinence; Levi Johnston posed for Playgirl.
But like star-crossed lovers, Palin and Johnston found a way to come back together, reuniting for the sake of their year-old son, Tripp.
""It's like Romeo and Juliet in Wasilla,"" Joy Behar said on ""The View.""
And while their relationship may seem rife with reality TV-like drama, according to Thomas Van Flein, the Palin family attorney, there's no plan for the young mom to chroncile her romance anytime soon.
""There is a lot of public speculation that Bristol and Levi have signed up for a reality show about their relationship,"" he said in a statement to ABC News today. ""They have not. While several networks have pitched different concepts, Bristol has not agreed to participate in any show. Her focus remains on doing what is best for Tripp and her family.""
Though they announced their engagement last week on the cover of US Weekly, senior editor Lindsay Powers said the news shouldn't come as a total surprise.
""About a month ago we saw the relationship thawing between them,"" Powers told ABCNews.com.
That's when Palin told ""Good Morning America"" that she was getting back together with Johnston for Tripp's sake.
""I am doing my best to raise a happy, active and healthy boy,"" Palin said. ""I believe that wherever possible, if the parents can cooperate and co-parent in a positive way, the child will benefit. Levi and I are turning a new page here as co-parents to this wonderful boy and putting aside the past because doing so is in Tripp's best interest.""
They certainly wouldn't be the first couple to reunite for the kids and they certainly won't be the last. But will other celebrity couples who have split up follow in their footsteps? Last week, several former couples made headlines. ABCNews.com thought it would be fun to take a look at their chances of getting back together. Powers ranked them from most to least likely.

"After this story aired on ""Good Morning America,"" K-Mart contacted the Hayes family to give them two $50 gift certificates to the store to help out with the sextuplets' many needs.
Sept. 14 means there's a birthday in the Hayes household, six times over. Three years ago, Eric and Elizabeth Hayes gave birth to sextuplets.
Then they were six bundles of joy, now they are six individual toddlers with distinct personalities.
Rachel's the Curious George of the group, E.J. is the shy one, and Ryan's the most outgoing, who believes in sharing, until push comes to bite. While Tara prefers her alone time, Connor, the resident drama king, enjoys his time at center stage.
Rebecca is the only sextuplet who is struggling -- she has cerebral palsy -- raising all the questions about the consequences of fertility medicine.
The Hayes already had three boys and one girl when they decided to give parenthood one more shot, in hopes of a sister for their daughter.
""And, you know, we hit the jackpot,"" Eric said. He explained that originally they thought they were having triplets, possibly quintuplets, but never sextuplets, until the third doctor's visit when he held up six fingers to tell the lucky parents what they had to look forward to.
Even with the shocking news, the Hayes said they never considered selective reduction, a practice used to reduce the number of implanted embryos.
""You tell me right now, who you wouldn't want to be here? Pick one, pick two, pick three, tell me. I couldn't do that,"" Eric Hayes said.
The older twins -- 9-year-olds Kieran and Meghan and 11-year-olds Kevin and Kyle â€“ do what they can to help with the often literally ""dirty"" half dozen.
The Hayes say the secret of each day is a constant schedule, gratitude and laughter, especially when it comes to watching shows like ABC's ""Super Nanny.""
""I like to see what kind of fools there are all out there 'cause we're handling it with 10 and they have one and two and they -- they're going bananas,"" Eric said.
Each day in the Hayes household means six loads of laundry, four runs of the dish washer and two full gallons of milk. But the biggest number is 120. That's the decibel level of six crying babies, and it's louder than a subway, an ambulance siren or a chainsaw.
""When they were infants all six of them would be crying and I would just stand there and I'd start to laugh because there's really nothing you can do outside of, you know, crying,"" Elizabeth said.
Ten cries, 10 laughs -- one beating heart of a family.

"Question: How is bipolar disorder different from unipolar depression or 'regular' depression?
Answer: Both bipolar disorder and major depression are typically associated with depressive episodes. So both illnesses are accompanied by depressions. The difference is that in bipolar disorder people also have periods of elevation -- or severe irritability.

"Nine people in South Korea have committed suicide in three separate incidents within two days. The latest was a 72-year-old man who hanged himself at a construction site in Hoengseong, Kangwon Province, Thursday, police said.
Four women and one man -- in their 20s and 30s -- were found dead Wednesday in Hwaseong, just south of Seoul, after sealing a passenger car with plastics sheets and inhaling toxic fumes from burned coal briquettes.
They left suicide notes saying, ""I have no more hope and no more dreams"" and ""please find my identification card in my back pocket.""
Police were investigating their motive but assumed that the man recruited the four women on the Internet to participate in a group suicide.
Earlier in another city east of Seoul, Chuncheon, three men in their 20s were also found dead at a private room-for-rent lodge using the same method and sealing the door and windows with dark masking tape from inside the room they were sharing.
Police assumed that they, too, were driven by group suicide pacts cultivated online.
Such news is common here where the suicide rate is the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development group of developed countries.
An average of 35.1 people killed themselves everyday in 2008, according to the health ministry. That's 24.3 for every 100,000 South Koreans, followed by 21 in Hungary, 19.4 in Japan, 16.7 in Finland and 15.8 in Belgium.
The National Statistics Office reported that the suicides are related to the economic downturn, as well as rapid social change within the family and the community.
Korean society in recent years has been plagued by continuous cases of suicide among celebrities, high-profile politicians and businessmen, teenagers and the elderly. Analysts say the most common cause is depression stemming from social and academic pressures or family troubles.
""There's a huge gap in this country because the speed of materialism spreading is much faster than the speed of cultural maturity that must grow together. It all comes from stress of rapid modernization,"" said Jeung Taek-Hee, an expert and consultant at Lifeline Korea.
Korean parents are having fewer children -- on average one per couple -- and more women are going into the workforce, which leaves the child alone. Although some corporations and government ministries are campaigning for workers to go home by 6 o'clock at least once a month to spend family time, Korean corporate culture still requires employees to participate in work-related dinners and stay late hours.
""Naturally, these busy parents end up spoiling the child who ends up self-centered and incapable of dealing with competition,"" Jeung said. ""But the reality is that this society is very, very competitive.""
Along with the miraculous rate of economic growth in the past decades, many South Koreans have become driven by materialism that has been passed on to their kids, Jeung said.
He noted that most of the people who commit suicide, especially the young teenagers, find themselves dangerously distressed by not being able to keep up with others materialistically and eventually become anti-social.
""The easiest place where they can meet friends who share the same pain is online through suicide communities or chat sites,"" Jeung said.
Once they find each other, they become, ""eternal comrades"" who ""must accompany each other to death,"" he said.
According to the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, 28.4 percent of young teenagers committed suicide in 2008 because of ""disturbed family relations,"" mostly the result of parental divorce, 19.6 percent from pessimistic depression and 10.1 percent from academic pressure.",<urn:uuid:2edc9224-49dc-4ff8-a3a7-e5c117b470e6>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://abcnews.go.com/International/south-korea-struck-online-suicide-pacts/story?id=10636608,2013-05-18T06:20:24Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.973295391,750,,,,,
"World leaders from 47 nations convene this week in Washington, D.C., for the Nuclear Security Summit, a gathering that the Obama administration hopes will raise awareness about the threats of nuclear arms getting into the hands of terrorists or ""rogue"" nations.
President Obama said Sunday the goal of the nuclear summit is to discuss the terrorist threat and getting countries to lock down their nuclear weapons in a specific time frame. The Obama administration itself has pledged to try to ""secure all vulnerable materials"" within four years and is hoping the summit will spark a case for preventive action among others.
""If there was ever a detonation in New York City or London or Johannesburg, the ramifications economically, politically, and from a security perspective would be devastating,"" Obama said on the eve of the summit. ""And we know that organizations like al Qaeda are in the process of trying to secure a nuclear weapon -- a weapon of mass destruction that they have no compunction of using.""
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said last week that the nuclear summit would be the largest of its kind hosted by a U.S. president since the U.N. conference in 1945.
But even as Obama brings the issue of nuclear security and disarmament into the spotlight -- first with the release of the new U.S. nuclear policy, and then the U.S.-Russia arms reduction agreement -- he faces significant challenges from two fronts.
Internationally, U.S. allies such as India, Pakistan and Israel have been resistant to signing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, citing national security concerns. The view in many countries is that this week's treaty signing aside, if the United States and Russia -- which together account for 95 percent of the world's nuclear arsenal and material -- cannot cut their nuclear stockpile, why should they be forced to?
""No one is willing to step up and say, 'Yea, I'm part of the problem here,"" said former national security official Ivan Oelrich, now vice president of the Strategic Security Program at the Federation of American Scientists. The ""U.S. and Russia have to lead the way in major reductions.""
Participant countries will also likely be looking to the United States for accountability. Henry Sokolsi, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, argues that if the United States is going to try to persuade other countries, it needs to shift its own policy at home too.
""I just think it's disrespectful to these countries,"" he said. ""Each country has its own problems. If we're not helping them on that, how can we expect them to not rely on them [nuclear weapons] to feel secure? We rely on them. Why should they be any different?""
Domestically, the partisan rift on Capitol Hill means possibly a tough fight ahead for Obama's nuclear agenda. Critics of the new nuclear policy released last week complain that it gives a free pass to countries such as Iran and North Korea, and Republican senators are already taking aim at the U.S.-Russia arms treaty that was signed last week, saying it hurts U.S. security interests.
The general consensus is that the treaty will eventually be ratified by the end of the year, but the issue is likely to be the subject of a heated political debate for much longer.",<urn:uuid:0a9b45ec-f8f1-41fa-82b8-42fdadb3c33f>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obamas-nuclear-security-summit-symbolic-gesture/story?id=10335607,2013-05-18T05:50:51Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.957307875,671,,,,,

"Exhausted and euphoric. Those are the words to describe me right now. Six days after boarding the ""Good Morning America"" Whistle-Stop '08 Tour train, and beginning the adventure of a lifetime, it's over.
We just wrapped the last show of our little Odyssey from the Newseum in the nation's capitol, Washington D.C., and for me, it was an appropriate but bittersweet ending to our tale.
Appropriate because the point of our tour was to go out and ask real people what was on their minds, to hear straight from them their concerns about our nation. By ending in Washington, D.C., we brought their thoughts, problems and hopes to the doorstep of the government -- to the people that can do something about them.
But it was also bittersweet because I honestly didn't want the trip to end.
I'm not going to lie to you and say that I loved everything about it (3:00 AM wake up calls being the main offender), but I was consistently surprised to find that even in the tougher times, when we had been blearily working for 18 hours straight, something or someone would come along to pick everyone up.
From the absolute chaos of pre-show preparations, to the fleeting sparkle of pride in the production team's eyes when a show went just as planned, life on the train was crazy, grueling and complicated, but most of all, fun.
Some moments I'll never forget.
Like the celebration in Massachusetts after we pulled off what had never been done before -- the first live network television broadcast from a moving train.
Or when Diane, Robin and Chris teamed up -- using Rick Klein and me as props -- to convince Sam that he was supposed to share his tiny room on the train with two roomates.
Or when Chris put his life on a very secure line at Niagara Falls to dramatically bring the news from the brink of watery doom.
Or, my personal favorite moment, when Sam, Chris and two producers played the most ridiculous game of Monopoly I've ever seen for four hours and a few of us, Sam included, cried from laughing so hard.
But far more moving than the obvious and endearing camaraderie between the anchors was their care for the American people to whom they bring the news every morning.
Never was this more obvious than yesterday, when I accidentally stumbled into an anchors' meeting where they discuss the content of the next day's show and, for some reason, I was allowed to stay.
As an aspiring journalist myself, I can't express how inspiring it was to listen in on this discussion and know firsthand that whatever goes on the air, it's the fairest, most accurate and most informative report possible. Though they have their fun, when it comes to the news Diane, Robin, Chris and Sam are professionals in every sense of the word.
But now I have to go -- have to return to ""normal"" life, and I don't want to.
I have to shave my rail-beard, the result of a production-wide pact to not shave for the duration of the trip. I have to wash some extremely smelly clothes. I also have a feeling that the spontaneous dance parties that erupted on the train will be for some reason looked down upon in the office.
These are all reasons to miss dragging myself aboard that cramped studio on rails well before the sun comes up. But maybe we'll be able to do it again sometime.
We were told to get back to New York however we wanted.
I think I'll take a train.",<urn:uuid:f00df4e1-9a25-4e7e-bd1e-0bba13621b1e>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://abcnews.go.com/politics/5050/story?id=5840462&category=Good%20Morning%20America,2013-05-18T06:44:58Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.97712183,739,,,,,

"Recently I've been taking a deep dive into the Reactive Extensions for .NET. This is a wonderful project that comes out of Cloud Programmability Division at Microsoft. Rx helps do to really wonderful things with asynchronous and parallel programming in unreliable distributed world. Do you remember what LINQ did to the collections (and much more)? Well, Rx is going to do (and doing) the same to events, asynchronous and distributed programming.
So if you have to deal anything that requires more than a single thread, process or machine to run - you'll be impacted in some way or the other.
The thing I love the most about what Eric Meijer and his team are doing - the underlying logic which is simple plain and so beautiful. Even the entire IObservable/IObserver thing could be logically derived from IEnumerable by inverting the concepts logically.
Just watch these videos, if you are interested in the details here (highly recommended):
What does this have to do with CQRS, Domain-Driven Design and Event Sourcing?
When I'm building some complex interactions and systems, I'm trying to follow the same principle. System design and evolution are not guided by the intuition or creativity. Pure logic and mathematical reason are the most reliable advisors here (it feels like proving a theorem). It's really hard to explain in words, but logically solid design can handle a lot of things with really little effort (and code) just because of it's nature. Basically it allows to say to new challenges: ""we did not code for this, but since this is logical, it already is in the design, you just need to enable this"".
While I'm just learning CQRS/DDD/ES I want to do it in the logical way that will prevent me from doing bad and illogical things (which will impact my systems later in their lifecycle). Way of thinking that Eric Meijer shows, seems to help here. Besides, it helps to merge the ideas of Pat Helland (almost infinitely scalable systems) into the overall CQRS concepts.
Reactive Extensions benefit a lot from the marble diagrams representing parallel processes and their interactions. So I've tried to re-apply these principles to my understanding of CQRS/DDD/ES. By mechanically reflecting the logic, here's what I've got for the command handler:
Essentially this picture reflects the flow of commands (marked with D for Do) incoming into the handler. Commands can come as a single or as a batch (that's the marble or tick in this reality). Commands coming together either succeed or fail together.
Each incoming tick translates into a new parallel reality for an aggregate (just like SelectMany in Rx, where you get observable of observable of T). Then we flatten successful commands onto the change stream (each change is a unit of work), while errors are flattened into the failure stream.
There is a message dispatcher that catches up upon these streams and sends domain events, command failures and confirmations back to the message bus. This way subscribers will have logically complete information about what's happened in the business logic. Subscribers could include sagas and event handlers working with read models (which will be used to provide clients with feedback that includes potential command failures).
Note a few differences upon the traditional CQRS with event sourcing approach as advocated by Greg Young:
- Aggregate Root can react to incoming commands by providing a finite stream of events, optionally terminating with error (there is a direct translation from Rx observers here: OnError and OnComplete).
- We save successful change (command(s) and resulting events) atomically as unit of work. Persisting commands will actually let us ensure command idempotency in the cruel world of scalable message queues (with ""at least once"" deliveries). Essentially this is reflection of Helland's activities that we need to have in the same scope with the aggregates that own them.
- Command failures are also saved (although the stream could be different from the event source). We don't need to save the intermediate events though - just command(s) and the resulting failure.
- Message dispatcher runs upon the failure and change streams, publishing domain events into the message bus. We have logically complete information here, that could eventually be provided for the client (sender) for the retrieval.
- theoretically we can easily process commands for a single aggregate in multiple threads, serializing access to the change and failure streams.
Things that do not fit in, yet:
- In CQRS practice there are cases, when there would traditionally be a call to the domain service (in the command handler and before the aggregate root). This does not fit in here. In a Rx world this would probably be a separate async command handler. Yet this would require an additional layer of translation (another command handler and event handler).
- events and commands are some sort of duals. They are both messages that bring along different intent and help to organize CQRS architecture (this comes from the DDD realm). Yet, this duality (and the rules coming out of it) brings additional complexity, when you need to chain multiple operations (first call unreliable operation, then pass the result to the aggregate, then do something else). I think I'm missing some aspect of commands and events that would help to lay out interactions in a clean and logical way.
That's a theory and logic as I see them today. This means:
- tomorrow perception might evolve into something different that better brings together known patterns and constraints.
- in theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice - there is a difference.
If I could bring in sagas, view event handlers and domain services into the picture in a logical way (and without breaking any existing scalability and consistency constraints), I'd be a happy man.
We'll see how it goes (see xLim 4: CQRS in Cloud series for any latest materials on this topic). Meanwhile I'm really interested in your thoughts on this subject.",<urn:uuid:aae437a0-dcca-4c82-a512-d261b6cf812d>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://abdullin.com/journal/2010/9/19/domain-driven-design-event-sourcing-rx-and-marble-diagrams.html,2013-05-18T05:53:46Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.94712019,1240,,,,,

"UK Takeover Code Amendments Come into Effect, Contributed by Alasdair Steele, Nabarro LLP
By Alasdair Steele, Nabarro LLP
The Code Committee of the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers has been consulting on proposed changes to the UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (City Code) for just over a year. The consultation and resultant changes largely arose following the outcry after Kraftâ€™s takeover of Cadbury and particularly the subsequent closure of Cadburyâ€™s Somerdale factory near Bristol, despite pledges in the offer document to keep the plant open. Originally, the consultation considered far-reaching ideas such as giving different voting rights to long-term and short-term shareholders and increasing the level of ownership required to control a company beyond the traditional 50 percent level.
Although a number of the more radical possibilities were rejected by the Code Committee earlier in the year, the proposed changes, which were initially unveiled in March 20111 and have now been published in final form,2 make a number of changes to the City Code which will affect the way in which takeover offers are effected. The changes are effective from 19 September 2011.
As expected, and despite some last minute lobbying, the final amendments largely reflect the Code Committeeâ€™s previous conclusions and the draft proposals published earlier this year.
The main themes of the changes are:
- Shifting the balance of power from offerors to target companies;
- Ending break fees, exclusivity and other deal-protection arrangements;
- Increasing transparency on advisersâ€™ fees;
- Holding offerors to account for their statements of intention; and
- Increasing employee involvement and information in offer processes.
Changes to the Takeover Code
â€” â€œVirtual Bidâ€ Periods
The default requirement in all takeover situations will be that potential offerors must be publicly named and then have a fixed 28-day period to either make their offer or withdraw from the process entirely. The 28-day period may only be extended on the joint application of the offeror and offeree to the Panel. This switches the onus away from the offeree board having to approach the Panel for a â€œput up or shut upâ€ deadline, in the event an offeror is laying siege to a target for a prolonged period of time without being identified.
This new requirement to identify a potential offeror will only apply when an announcement of a potential offer is required, and as a result, potential offerors will be further encouraged to protect the confidentiality of the process for a longer period of time. Potential offerors will not, however, be able to restrict (or attempt to restrict) the offeree from disclosing their identity where there City Code requires that disclosure.
The Panel is expected to be receptive to requests to extend the 28-day period, particularly where good reasons can be shown why the process is taking longer. Friendly, recommended offers should therefore be able to proceed on a slightly slower timetable while hostile or unwelcome offerors will be forced to move with much more decisiveness.
There is a limited exception from the proposed identification regime and time limits where an offeree announces that it is conducting a formal sale process and seeking one or more potential offerors. The details of the sale process and proposed participants will not then need to be made public. In order to qualify for this exemption, the offeree will need to formally put itself up for sale; traditional â€œstrategic reviewâ€ announcements, often seen as code for putting themselves up for sale, will not be sufficient.
â€” Deal Protection Measures
Deal protection measures will be completely prohibited except in very limited circumstances. The restriction will apply to â€œoffer-related arrangements,â€ which are generally defined as â€œany agreement, arrangement or commitment in connection with an offerâ€ and will apply to currently common arrangements such as:
- Inducement fee and break fee arrangements;
- Implementation agreements;
- Exclusivity arrangements; and
- â€œWork-feeâ€ arrangements.
Inducement fees will still be permitted in exceptional circumstances such as where a â€œwhite knightâ€ offeror3 makes an offer following the announcement of a hostile offer. The inducement fee will, however, be of limited value as it will only apply if a third competing offeror were to materialise and succeed, not if the original hostile offeror were to succeed.
As anticipated, the City Code itself will now contain specific provisions regarding takeovers which are implemented by way of schemes of arrangement to ensure that offeree companies adhere to any timetable and process agreed with the offeror and included in the offer documentation.
â€” Disclosure of Fees
The estimated fees payable by offerors and offerees will need to be disclosed in offer documents. These will be broken down by category of adviser, with the fee for each of the offeror and offeree and in respect of the offerorâ€™s financing arrangements being split out separately.
The new rules address different fee structures, such as success fees, by providing the ability to disclose expected fees and maximum fees so as to protect commercially sensitive information, such as the thresholds at which success fees may kick in. Where the disclosure subsequently proves inadequate, updated information may need to be publicly announced.
â€” Increased Disclosure Requirements
Increased disclosure about the financing of offers will be required, with copies of the financing documents to be made available on the offerorâ€™s website. Certain commercially sensitive information, such as headroom to increase an offer, may be withheld, as may the structure by which equity is provided to private equity offeror vehicles; a general disclosure as to how much is sourced from each fund will be sufficient.
Separately, all-cash offerors need to disclose additional information, putting them on par with offerors offering securities as consideration, though this will not extend to information such as a pro forma balance sheet reflecting the offer and significant change statements since their last audited accounts.
â€” Statements as to Future Conduct
Following the public and political criticism following Kraftâ€™s closure of Cadburyâ€™s Somerdale factory, the City Code is being strengthened to try to force more and better disclosure.
Offerors will be required to include enhanced statements of their intentions for the offeree business and its employees as well as information about the effect of the offer on its own business. They will then be expected to hold to those statements for either any period specified in the statement or, in the absence of any statement, at least 12 months following the offer becoming unconditional. Offerors will only be released from these statements if there has been a material change in circumstances.
In order to counter the risk that the new rule will encourage vague and general statements, the Code Committee has stated that an offeror should disclose as fully as possible its commercial rationale for the takeover and that general statements are unlikely to be acceptable where an offeror has had an opportunity to undertake full due diligence.
â€” Employee Involvement
Employees and employee representatives will have enhanced rights to comment on the effects on employment of a proposed offer and to have their costs in obtaining advice to verify the information contained in their opinion paid for by the offeree company.
The Code Committee has stated its view that the costs should be limited to those required to verify the statement by reference to existing sources and not to the provision of general advice as to the opinion or to the commissioning of new research to substantiate an opinion. However, it is likely that there will be debates in the future over the extent of the costs which will be covered, particularly in takeover situations which attract employee and trade union opposition.
In addition, offeree companies will be required to publish the opinion of the employees or employee representatives on their websites (and announce having done so) when the opinion is received too late to be included in the offer documentation. Under the old rules, there was no provision requiring this opinion to be published if it was not received in sufficient time to be included within the offer documents.
â€” â€œVirtual Bidâ€ Periods
Where an offeree is in an offer period on the implementation date and if it was in talks with or had received an approach from an offeror at the beginning of the offer period, the identity of the potential offeror will need to be announced by 5 p.m. on the implementation date.
Separately, any potential offeror identified in an announcement made on or before the implementation date must, by not later than 5 p.m. on the 28th day after the implementation date, either:
- Announce a firm intention to make an offer;
- Announce it does not intend to make an offer; or
- Together with the offeree company, obtain Panel consent to an extension of the deadline.
â€” Deal Protection Measures
Inducement fees or other offer-related arrangements entered into before the implementation date will not be subject to the new prohibition.
â€” Offer Documents & Offeree Board Circulars
Where the offeror publishes the initial offer document before the implementation date, all subsequent offer-related documents must comply with the City Codeâ€™s provisions as they were before the implementation date, irrespective of when those documents are published.
â€” Employee Involvement
Offeree companies will be required to publish employee representativesâ€™ opinions on a website and announce having done so with effect from the implementation date, even if the offer document to which the employee representativesâ€™ opinion relates was published before the implementation date.
Despite the extensive nature of these changes, the Code Committee has already flagged future areas of amendment, such as imposing an ongoing obligation to update material information as it changes, and not only when the next offer-related document is published.

Partitioning of carbon, water, and energy fluxes between understory and canopy in a North Central Florida mature uneven aged pine flatwoods forest.
Starr, Gregory*,1, Powell, Thomas1, Martin, Timothy1, Gholz, Henry1,2, 1 School of Forestry Resources and Conservation, Gainesville, FL2 National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA
ABSTRACT- Of the 5.93 million ha of timberland within the state of Florida, only 19% are maintained under conditions classified as ""natural"" pine forest. While considerable attention has been focused on the carbon and water dynamics of managed pine plantations in the region, little attention has been given to these natural forests, which are an integral part of the complex mosaic of lands in the region. Based on this importance, it was our intention to quantify how environmental conditions affect ecosystem carbon, water, and energy exchange within a mature pine flatwoods forest and determine how specific components of the system, (i.e. leaf physiology, soil respiration, understory composition and canopy structure), contribute to these exchange rates. During the 2000-2001 field season, the natural pine flatwoods was a carbon sink with an annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of 183 g C m-2. The largest portion of this carbon was sequestered during the winter and spring when temperatures were cooler and canopy LAI was lowest. This could be attributed to a reduction in ecosystem respiration losses and a slight increase in understory photosynthetic rates caused by a larger portion of total radiation reaching the understory. Approximately 90% of the respiratory losses from the system could be accounted through soil respiration, which is highly correlated to soil water potential (r2=0.77, p<0.001). Comparison of eddy covariance measurements above and below the pine canopy indicated that 37% of the ecosystemÃ­s carbon, 51 % of its latent energy, and 56% of its sensible heat fluxes could be attributed to the understory. Preliminary results show that two species, Serenoa repens and Ilex glabra, comprise 95% of the understory vascular and both have relatively high leaf nitrogen concentration and photosynthetic capacities (~1.4% nitrogen and Amax ~ 4.0 mmol m-2 s-1) and account for ~ 90% of the carbon sequestered by the understory community. These initial assessments provide evidence that natural pine flatwood forest of Florida may be a small regional carbon sink.

"Pneumonia is a common cause for ED visits. How do you decide on whether the patient can be managed as an outpatient or inpatient? To supplement your clinical judgment, many clinicians use the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) score.
Have you heard of CURB-65, supported by the British Thoracic Society? What about SMART-COP, which is meant to help you predict if your patient will need Intensive Respiratory or Vasopressor Support (IRVS)?
It's worth a quick review.

A new CME publication has emerged from the publishers of Emergency Medicine Practice and Pediatric Emergency Medicine Practice called EM Critical Care. This new publication is specifically geared towards manging critically ill patients in the ED. There will be 6 issues per year with each issue offering 3 AMA PRA Category 1 credits. Although it has not yet been released, it appears to have an impressive editorial board including Emanuel Rivers, Michael Gibbs, Benjamin Abella and Robert Arntfield.

In a Research Letter in JAMA, Dr. Chretien et al describe the profile of physicians in the Twitter universe, specifically focusing on professionalism.
Self identified physician
At least 500 followers during May 1-31, 2010 (Whew, I only have 309 followers.)
Posted a tweet within last 6 months
A total of 260 physicians were studied.
6.2% were from Emergency Medicine.
15% (most) were from Surgery and its subspecialties.
76% were from the United States.
Three physicians independently coded the 20 most recent tweets from each account (total n= 5,156) for unprofessional content. There were 144 (3%) unprofessional tweets from 27 users:
55 (1%) - possible conflict of interest, advocating for non-standard therapies
38 (0.7%) - potentially violation of patient privacy
33 (0.6%) - profanity
14 (0.3%) - sexually explicit material
4 (0.1%) - discriminatory statement
25 of 27 (92%) of users were identifiable
The authors conclude that, although rare, there should be more physician accountability and guidelines in the age of social media. This is even more true, since I just discovered that all tweets are archived by the Library of Congress!
Take a look at your most recent tweets. How would they have performed if you were included in this study?

Dr. Rob Orman of ERCast blog fame emailed me last week about creating a pocket card on Suicide Risk Stratification. In many community ED's, risk assessment is done by the emergency physician. I'm lucky where I work, because we have a 24/7 psychiatric ED, which consults on suicidal patients in the ""medical ED"".
In the end, assessment is primarily based on physician judgment, because there's no great clinical decision tool, rules, or scores to assess risk. Rob has created his own mnemonic to help you ask the right questions in assessing a suicidal patient. This is a sneak peak into a larger article that Rob is planning to unleash on the world on suicide assessment. Based on his review of the literature and own clinical experience, the mnemonic is: TRAAPPED SILO SAFE.
""Risk factors"" which increase a patient's risk for committing suicide in the near future.
""Protective factors""which decrease a patient's risk for committing suicide in the near future.

Ever since my post about the top medical apps, I have been inundated with people asking me to review their apps.
One has stood out.
Medibabble is a real-time medical translation app and is now available for FREE. It was created by two innovative UCSF medical school graduates, Dr. Alex Blau and Dr. Brad Cohn. This app contains an extensive preset list of history questions and physical exam commands. When you click on a sentence, the app will translate and speak the sentence in one of 5 languages (Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, Russian, and Haitian Creole).
Take a few minutes to download all of the free languages onto your device. It only comes with Spanish pre-installed. There is a FAQ page at www.medibabble.com. The app is only available for the iOS platform currently.
Does your Emergency Department have computerized spectrophotometric catheters to measure continuous central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) in early goal directed therapy (EGDT) for severe sepsis? That's what was used in the original Rivers' EGDT study.
I've never even seen one before.
Many emergency physicians are getting around not having the specialized equipment issue by obtaining intermittent venous blood gas measurements off of a central venous line.
But what if you had a 30 y/o woman with early pyelonephritis/urosepsis who has severe sepsis by definition? She's got 10 peripheral lines (I'm exaggerating, of course), a normalized blood pressure with early IV fluids, and appears non-toxic. Her lactate, however, is 9! Do you really need a central line? My gut says no, but the EGDT protocol says yes -- for the purpose of CVP and ScvO2 measurements.
Trick of the Trade:
Use a less-invasive approach where bedside ultrasound and serial venous lactate levels replace central venous lines and ScvO2 measurements, respectively.
Last year, JAMA published a landmark study showing that lactate clearance of â‰¥10% over the first 2 hours is ""not a worse measurement"" than ScvO2â‰¥70%. This double-negative statistical speak came about because it was a non-inferiority study.
So how does this affect the original Rivers protocol? To review, here's the original protocol, which I posted about earlier:
(click to view larger image)
In the less invasive model:
Fluid resuscitate through peripheral IV access instead of a central line.
Follow volume status either with a bedside ultrasound or urine output.
Follow venous lactate levels at time 0 and 2 hours. If the lactate clearance is â‰¥10% over these 2 hours, you should follow the algorithm as if the ScvO2â‰¥70%. That means no need for immediate transfusion or vasopressor agents.
How do you know when you have adequately volume-resuscitated a patient using bedside ultrasound? Measure the IVC diameter about 1-2 cm from the right atrium junction.
If the IVC diameter â‰¤1.5 cm and has â‰¥50% collapse with inspiration, the patient has a very low CVP.
If the IVC diameter is at least 1.5 cm and has minimal collapse with inspiration, the patient is euvolemic. Move to the next step -- assessing the MAP.
This doesn't mean that all EGDT patient should have ONLY peripheral lines. Persistent hypotension, a non-clearing lactate level, and/or clinical toxicity warrant more invasive monitoring and management.

In its third official year, the Clerkship Directors in Emergency Medicine (CDEM) organization is still growing strong. It all started with six of us at an informal dinner in Boston about 5 years ago. And now the organization has grown so large that it is now for the first time offering annual awards to its members.
Know an award-worthy educator? Nominate him or her!
CDEM Clerkship Director of the Year Award
This award recognizes an Emergency Medicine Clerkship Director that has made significant contributions to either a 3rd or 4th year EM rotation. To be eligible for this award, the nominee must currently be a Clerkship Director of a mandatory, selective or elective rotation and have served in that role for a minimum of 5 years. This award is presented at the annual CDEM meeting.
CDEM Young Educator of the Year Award
This award recognizes a medical student educator at the Clinical Instructor or Assistant Professor level and less than 10 year from residency completion who has made significant contributions to teaching and educating medical students. This award is presented at the annual CDEM meeting.
CDEM Distinguished Educator Award
This award recognizes a medical student educator at the Associate Professor or Professor level who has made significant contributions to and has demonstrated sustained excellence in teaching and educating medical students for 10 or more years. This award is not presented annually; rather, it is bestowed on special occasions.
CDEM Award for Innovation in Medical Education
This award recognizes a medical student educator at any faculty rank who has made a significant and innovative contribution to undergraduate medical education. This award is presented at the annual CDEM meeting.
By learning about our differences, we can learn to appreciate and better communicate with those who are different from us.
The same falls true for working with residents and faculty from different ""generations"", as defined as traditionalists, baby boomers, generation Xers, and millennials.
This literature review and consensus document is quite extensive and even comes in 2 parts in Academic Emergency Medicine. There is a great summary table of the generational differences in personal, work, and educational characteristics, communication styles, and technology.
Think of faculty who fit in these age groups. Do they fit their generational stereotype?
Traditionalists (born 1925-1945)
Personal characteristics: Loyal, reluctant to change, dedicated, value honor and duty, patriotic
Work characteristics: Value hierarchy, loyal ""company man"", job security
Education characteristics: Process oriented
Communication style: Formal
Technology: Tend not to understand
Baby Boomers(born 1945-1964)
Personal characteristics: Optimistic, desire for personal gratification, highly competitive
Work characteristics: Workaholic, competitive, consensus builder, mentor
Education characteristics: Learner depends on educator, lecture format, process-oriented
Communication style: Diplomatic
Technology: Not particularly techno-saavy
Generation Xers (born 1964-1980)
Personal characteristics: Independent, self-directed, skeptical, resilient, more accepting of diversity, self-reliant
Work characteristics: Value work-life balance, comfortable with change, question authority
Education characteristics: Independent learners, problem-solvers, desire to learn on the job, outcome-oriented
Communication style: Blunt
Technology: Interested and facile
Millennials (born 1980-1999)
Personal characteristics: Optimistic, need for praise, collaborative, global outlook
Work characteristics: Team-oriented, follows rules and likes having structured time, career changes
Education characteristics: Team-based learning environment, turn to Internet for answers, outcome-oriented
Communication style: Polite
Technology: Very saavy, technology is a necessity
The authors give multiple examples where generational differences come to light but none more so than in mentorship within the academic department.
Traditionalists view mentorship as a more formal process, where feedback is necessary only to provide criticism or suggestions for improvement.
Baby boomers also view mentorship as a ""top down"" process. They are ok with infrequent interactions.
Generation Xers and Millennialsprefer mentorship as a more ""peer to peer"" process with more frequent interactions. They value the personal relationships and the opportunity to collaborate in creative solutions. Because of their stereotypical distrust of authority, however, they may inadvertently sabotage their relationship with their mentors. Distrust sometimes is misinterpreted as a general lack of respect.
To overcome these differences, mentor-mentee pairings should take into consideration gender and shared views about goals, work/life balance, and experiences. Early discussions in a mentorship relationship should discuss generational differences and how each envisions the ideal mentor-mentee relationship to be. The pair should agree upon and adopt a collaborative, shared communication approach with frequent feedback.
So much more in this article... Take a read.

A 50 year-old woman, who presented to the ENT clinic for followup check of a facial fracture, has a blood pressure of 210/100. She is asymptomatic and in no pain. She gets referred immediately to the ED for care.
Now you see her in your ED. What next?
There is a lot of controversy whether you should treat or not treat asymptomatic hypertension in the ED. The ACEP Clinical Policy says that there is no need to immediately reduce an asymptomatic patient's blood pressure. With ""close followup"", they can be referred to their primary care physician.
With so many patients being uninsured or unable to access their primary care physician on short notice, many emergency physicians like myself are slowly moving towards starting antihypertensive medications for them.
If you do decide to start an antihypertensive, which medication do you choose? This Paucis Verbis card is based on a 2009 Cochrane Review, and summarized in American Family Physician in 2010. The blue numbers denote a Risk Ratio (RR) which cross 1, meaning that there is no benefit. The red numbers denote a RR < 1, meaning that there IS a benefit.
A low-dose thiazide, such as hydrochlorothiazide 12.5-25 mg po daily, is a safe and effective choice.

A health care worker hurried in to the ED after being poked with a needle.
'It was an old 18G needle with dried blood', she said. Her puncture had drawn blood. You discussed the very low risk of contacting HIV and the side effects of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). She asked, 'What does very low risk mean?'
Is there another way to covery risk for patients?
Trick of the Trade: Convey probabilities with everyday risks.
This article uses a risk stratifying tool to convey probabilities that compare to everyday risks such as flying, cancer diagnosis, having an MI, etc. Below is the calculation tool from the paper.
Using this tool, the risk of contacting HIV for this patient would be:
5/ (1000 x 100 x 100) = 1/ 2,000,000
According to the everyday risk table in the article, this is similar to the risk of dying in the next 12 months from lightning. You left her to decide on PEP.
As the author pointed out, the risks cited are probabilities instead of exact measurements. This is an important caveat.
I find this helpful to provide context, especially for those who have difficulty deciding on PEP.

Many academic Emergency Departments are staffed by non-EM residents. Dr. Amer Aldeen and his super-star team from Northwestern created NURRC Modules (Northwestern University Rotating Resident Curriculum). These modules allow the off-service residents, who all have different schedules, to learn key EM-based topics at their own leisure and convenience.
The positive effect of the curriculum on the off-service residents' medical knowledge was recently published in Academic Emergency Medicine: Read my review.
NURRC Video Modules:
ENT and Ophthalmology Emergencies
Obstetrics and Gynecology Emergencies
Trauma and Wound Care
Thanks to the team for agreeing to make these videos free for everyone to use.
I hope I wasn't too pushy or forward in asking for the videos... and then asking if I could post then all on YouTube! Such a great resource shouldn't live behind closed doors. I'll post the other 3 videos once I receive them from Amer.
It is 2 a.m. You, the resident, have just spoken to your staff/attending, who told you to do a task. You have seen one, but don't feel comfortable doing one independently.
Will you tell your staff/attending about how you feel?
What if the patient did poorly after that?
This study examines the perception of EM trainees of their competence and adverse events and how they feel about reporting them.
Anonymous web-based survey sent to all trainees from 9 EM programs in Canada outside Quebec.
37.3% trainees responded.
40% trainees felt they had minimal supervision when doing a task that they did not feel safe about.
Most 'unsafe' tasks included providing care overnight, admission decision or procedures.
When feeling incompetent, a third of trainees will not report this to their staff.
Barriers include worry about loss of trust, automony or respect.
64% trainees felt responsible for contributing to adverse events.
Most relate to procedures - chest tubes, central lines, paracentesis.
Majority, but not all, reported the most serious events to the staff.
Barriers include fear of appearing incompetent and humiliation.
How would I change my teaching practice
Ensure trainees feel safe. Maybe do a dry run of central line insertion/break bad news prior.
Encourage trainees to voice their discomfort. They are learning, not just working.
Discuss adverse events and medical errors with trainees.

Medgadget annually hosts a contest for the best medical blogs. It's the Superbowl of blogs.
Our blog was nominated for the Best New Medical Blog last year, but got our butt kicked.
This year, we're honored to be a finalist in the Best Clinical Sciences Blog category. That's the great news. Unlucky for us, we are in the same category as the juggernauts EMCrit (also nominated in the overall Best Medical Blog category) and Resus.M.E. I do love the fact that the EM specialty is dominating with 3 finalists in this list of 5.
With all of the amazing, sunny weather here in California, I feel (briefly) terrible for all those braving the snowpocalyptic conditions across the United States. So, in honor of all those bundled up and shivering, I wanted to review the management of accidental hypothermia.
Tip: Avoid jostling the hypothermic patient too much because of myocardial irritability. Don't send your patient into an arrhythmia.

In his talk (subtitled ""School Sucks""), Northwestern University Physics Professor Dr. Tae describes how he would improve math and science education. While this is directed at college studies, some of the concepts are applicable to teaching Emergency Medicine.
He shares a lot of great insight, but I wanted to focus on one concept in particular:
The secret to learning = ""Work your ass off until you figure it out.""
Dr. Tae demonstrates this as we watch him make 57 failed attempts trying to learn a new skateboarding trick before finally being able to successfully complete it on the 58th. In order to master this new skill, he had to actively struggle with it until he succeeded. He contrasts this with lectures where students ""just sit there"" passively, learning very little.
Clinical decision making is a skill, much like skateboarding, and our job in teaching this may be to let the students do most of the work. We're only there to offer guidance and point them in the right direction when necessary. So how can we challenge our students to struggle and fail until they ultimately figure it out?
Share your thoughts and ideas in the comments. Thanks!
Patients with a hairy chest may require little patches of hair to be shaved when applying EKG leads. This allows the leads to stick firmly to the chest. Loose leads will result in either an artifactual signal or no signal at all on the EKG machine.
How can you obtain an EKG without shaving little patches on the patient's chest?
Trick of the Trade: Cover EKG leads with damp gauze
Water maximes the contact surface area between the EKG lead and the patient's skin. The water easily conducts the cardiac electrical signal.
Generously soak gauze with water.
Apply gauze over each EKG lead where it contacts hairy skin.

Well I finally took the leap and am primarily relying on my iPhone to look up medication doses, which I don't know off the top of my head. Gone are the days of purchasing Tarascon's pocket Pharmacopoeia every few years or so.
I still haven't settled on which I like more. Both are free. Both are available on multiple platforms, including iOS, Blackberry, and Android. Both have some unique features which I find useful.
Common strengths for both apps:
Easy to find drug you are looking for. Epocrates has a Search screen as the home page. Micromedex has a Search screen and alphabetical list of medications as the home page.
Dosing adjustments based on renal and hepatic function
Adult and pediatric dosing recommendations
Safety information with preganancy and lactation
Unique strengths of the apps:
Includes toxicology information for all the medications (what to do in case of an overdose)
I have heard that this Thomson Reuters app has been more peer-reviewed and accepted as a very reliable resource, especially for pediatric dosing.
Free from obvious advertisements (which is sometimes seen in Epocrates via the Doc Alerts)
Has pricing information
Allows user to identify unknown pill based on pill characteristics (color, shape, etc)
Ability for you to take notes on the app
They both will likely answer 99% of what you are looking for from a drug-prescribing perspective.

"Itâ€™s probably the height of arrogance for me to write a post about how one should taste whiskey. There are loads of people out there who have already covered this base, and they are far more knowledgeable on the subject. For me, whiskey is first and foremost about stories and anecdotes. The tasting of the alcohol is simply the fuel that allows the stories to flow more freely (oo.. how poetic! Iâ€™ll have to remember that bit).
But, for the sake of those out there who have never thought about â€œtastingâ€ whiskey, itâ€™s good to put this information out there. And since I will be posting various tastings on this here site, itâ€™s a good idea to give you all the process I will be using.
First and foremost, letâ€™s get one thing out of the way. Thereâ€™s a huge chasm between the idea of tasting whiskey and the idea of enjoying whiskey. One activity does not necessarily have to include the other. If you enjoy making cocktails out of the various whiskeys available on the market, then have at it. But itâ€™s impossible to get a clear taste of whiskey once you adulterate it with bitters, ginger ale, or sour mix.
Additionally, tasting a whiskey involves more than simply putting it into your mouth and swallowing. Itâ€™s an encompassing experience, using the same amount of our senses as we use when consuming any other food or drink. So letâ€™s define tasting as the act of learning the characteristics of the flavor of whiskey through the use of the senses. But which senses? The same ones used for tasting wine and judging food â€“ seeing, smelling, and tasting.
The eyes gives us insight into the drink. It can tell us how young it is, or the kind of barrel in which it was aged. Generally speaking, the lighter the whiskey, the younger it will be. Whiskey straight from the still is often white, while there are some whiskeys out there that have been aged so long than they have a deep red to them. Bourbon gets it amber red color from the new and freshly charred oak barrels used in its aging process. If bourbon did not use new barrels, or if they didnâ€™t char the new barrels they did use, the Kentucky spirit would have a completely different color.
Finding the nose of the whiskey is even more important than the look of it. Some would say that the aromas of the whiskey is more important than the taste. From my reading, Iâ€™ve found that itâ€™s not uncommon for blenders to base their recipes primarily on aromas. But if youâ€™re not a blender, the nose is of secondary importance, behind taste.
To release the aromas of whiskey, a little water may be necessary. The best way to think of this is that a bit of water wakes up the whiskey that has been asleep from anywhere from 3 to 25 years. But how much water? According to Michael Jackson, you want to add just enough water dilute to around 30% alcohol by volume. Roughly speaking, this translates to a .5 to 1 water to whiskey ratio if your drinking 80 proof whiskey, or a 1 to 1 water to whiskey ratio if youâ€™ve found yourself a whiskey thatâ€™s 100 proof. This is simply a rule of thumb, and one should expect many exceptions to this, especially in the older whiskeys.
A quick side note â€“ ice should be avoided, as well as chilled water, as they close down the aromatics of the whiskey. The water added should lack any obvious characteristics of its own. For example, you wouldnâ€™t add mineral water to your whiskey. It is said that the best water to add to the whiskey is the water found at the site where the whiskey was distilled. Since Iâ€™ll assume that the vast majority of you out there are not millionaires, and cannot fly off to Kentucky or Speyside simply for a drink of whiskey, letâ€™s just stick to bland water.
So what are you looking for when you smell a whiskey? That Iâ€™ll leave up to you to decide. From my point of view, there are no wrong answers to this question, because tasting is a very personal experience. If you place your snoot in a dram and the aromas remind you of Newark, then by god, thatâ€™s what you experienced. Yes, there is a vocabulary used by professional tasters, and usually they are simply variations of more broad terms (woody, fruitful, medicine, smoky, citrus-like). The aromas you find will likely trigger some sort of sense memory. The skill of a professional taster is to put a very specific and accurate word to describe their own sense memory. Or to put it another way, an amateur taster may say that a drink smells a bit fruity and a bit woody. A good taster will say that a whiskey carries a strong oak smell with an undercurrent of raisins. A great taster will say that the whiskey had been in two different casks, one that used in bourbon and the more recent one used in the making of sherry; additionally, there are hints of currants and peaches, as well as a little bit of vanilla.
All of these answers are right. The reason the last taster was able to put more words to the aromas was because they do this activity more often.
Thatâ€™s the end of part 1. Tomorrow, Iâ€™ll post about whiskey glasses, and what to do once you actually put the whiskey in your mouth. And, as always, feel free to correct any of my mistakes by addressing them in the comments of this post.",<urn:uuid:574a5d4e-cf33-4332-b205-9d281ca214eb>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://accidentalhedonist.com/how-to-taste-whiskey-pt-1/,2013-05-18T06:43:12Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.959721863,1182,,,,,

"Well, these are still some
difficult questions to answer with pin-point accuracy, and at this point I don't
believe anyone has the exact answer to all 3 of these questions. What I offer
below is a mix of what I Think, What I know and what Appears to be....
Anyone currently attempting to
answer these questions with some type of ""Universal Knowledge"" on the
subject--is Full of BS--BEWARE! Yes, that includes Me. I don't have the
Complete answer to these questions--and neither does anyone else. This is
a subject that needs to be studied in-depth by someone that has all the
resources to carry it out: Lab, veterinary knowledge/skills, Acrochordus snakes,
What is it:
At this point--I don't know, but here
is what I believe based on experience, observation and research: The skin of the
Acrochordus javanicus and arafurae is very impermeable. So, that makes it a very
protective mechanism against the outside world. It is commonly understood that
""Stress"" causes a reduction in the ability of the immune system to do its
job--in humans and other animals--including Acrochordus snakes. Stress appears
to cause a decline in the immune system of Acrochordus snakes causing a decline
in the effectiveness of the skin as a protective barrier against the outside
world. This loss of effectiveness increases until Secondary Infections set in and
ultimately kill the animal.
Where does it come from:
See the paragraph above and add:
Improper Husbandry. Yes, it really is that simple. In the Wild, these animals
have the ability to move from Habitat to Habitat--Microenvironment to
Microenvironment. Even though the White Spot Fungus appears to be a ""Captivity""
Problem--the snakes in the Wild maybe be able to prevent it--not by some
""Magical Bacteria"", but, rather: by simply selecting
Environments/Microenvironments that they are ""Happy"" with--i.e., minimum
sustained stress level. In Captivity--the snakes don't have that choice. Plain
and Simple. Additionally, it appears that the more acclimated to captivity that
these snakes get--the more secretive and stress prone they become.
How do We get rid of it:
Proper Husbandry--Yes, it really is
that simple. Reduction of ""Stress"" will reduce the Progression of the White Spot
Fungus. I have seen it myself. Elimination of Stress will Halt the progression
of White Spot Fungus. Note: I did not say anything about chemicals, medications,
etc.--just eliminate the Stress and the progression of the White Spot will stop.
What is there will remain until the next shed. After the next shed--the animal
will be clean and remain that way--as long as all of the husbandry parameters
are and remain in order. Its just that Simple. A new animal going through the
acclimation process may need to shed 2, 3 or even 4 times before the White Spot
relents completely. However, its progress should be visibly reduced with each
So, what is ""Proper
Husbandry""? Well, that's what this website is about. No, I don't have all the
answers right now, but I've come a long way in the last couple of yrs dedicated
to these snakes.
1) If You are genuinely
interested in these snakes--then read this website: Every page, every word, look
at every picture. This website is not setup for those who are just mildly
curious at best. Those folks are more then welcome here. But a lot of
information is ""Hidden"" within the text for those who are serious about these
animals. Nothing is truly ""Hidden"", but even this explanation is not sitting on
the Front Page for the ""Scanners"" to see.
2) Spend the hours necessary
researching these animals for Yourself. Right now, the more people that reach
the same conclusions--based upon knowledge and experience--the Better. The
Online Bibliography at the
link is a Good place to start.
3) Acidic water (pH~6.0), Low
TDSs (~200ppm), Low light--especially in the hide, Lack of vibrations, etc are
Good key elements to the reduction of Stress and the furtherance of ""Proper
Recently (4/2007) I have seen
a couple of ""For Sale"" ads for Acrochordus javanicus for one vendor that are
wrought with misinformation--therefore: Misguidance on the keeping of these
snakes. One ad was for CB Babies basically stating to put them in acidic water
and because they are CB and White Spot free--You (the buyer) don't need to worry
about any future ""Bacterial Infections"". Sorry, it just doesn't work that way.
The current ad states:
""I have adult specimens of Acrochordus javanicus, about 4' in
length. Perfect specimens with no scrapes, scar, and most importantly NO SKIN
BLISTERS! As many people know WC adult Acrochordus javanicus are very rarely
offered for sale, primarily because of the high mortality rates due to improper
packaging during transport which causes skin blisters (Pseudomonas bacteria
which cause septicemia, aka ""Blood Poisoning"").
You won't have to worry about that here. These adults came in perfectly and
there were transported correctly. I am only able to offer unsexed specimens.
This species is usually female heavy. There are many reports of this species
being able to be parthogenetic, with LTC females ""cloning"" themselves. A great
display snake, they feed on fish. As with all Acrochordids, I reccomend great
filtration and the regular addition of a product called ""koi zyme.""
I am asking $250.00 per a specimen, quanities are limitied. Once
these are gone I will be a few more years until such nice large animals come
Information. Improper packaging/shipping is only one factor and most importantly:
""You won't have to worry about that here."" That's Pure
Non-Sense. I am familiar with
this particular individual. He claims to have ""...many years of Experience with
Aquatic Snakes."" and apparently did a stint at a local zoo which I guess makes
him a Guru in his own mind. His website is and has remained void of his Great
claims of ""accomplishments"" (suddenly that's changing 6/07 LoL) and has been up for a few yrs now. Buy the
snakes--just don't buy into the BS claims. Apparently this person thinks that
you just need to buy the ""Clean"" animal from him, toss it into ""acidic water""
via peat moss, add Koizyme and Wha-La: Instant Acrochordus! Again, Sorry, it
doesn't work that way. If it were that simple: Someone would have
figured it out a Looong time ago. I have used Salt, Koizyme, Melafix and
Pimafix. I have also researched those products and contacted the manufactures
with any specific questions that I had. One thing that I can tell you is:
None. Not One of those products are necessary to successfully
keep an Acrochordus javanicus or arafurae, Or halt the White Spot Fungus. More
importantly, in reference to the Ads,--Just because You receive a clean
animal--doesn't mean that it is going to stay that way. That whole
thought process is coming from a Total lack of Experience. If that
were True--Plenty of people would be successfully keeping
Javanicus. Am I being
Hardcore: Maybe. But I don't think that I am. I am tired of seeing these snakes
die--that's why I am working with them with the dedication that I am. That's why
I put up this website--including all of the hours and hours of putting it
together and the added expense. That's why I am willing to Openly call these
so-called ""Gurus"" out here--and on the Forums. Sadly, they don't go
""heads-up"" with me in public any more. They just continue to hold onto their
erroneous beliefs and pass along their Bad Information. These
animals will always go to the skin trade. But let's get it together and get them
established in captivity, so they will always be around, and so people will be
able to experience and enjoy their unique presence. I'm no rocket scientist, but
I am a guy that can do research and think my way through most problems. If
Acrochordus husbandry was as simple as some make it sound: This website would
not be here. And You can tell from reading this website that A) its not that
simple, and B) its a lot more involved than the ""Gurus"" want You to believe. I
have come across a number of individuals that all claim that they have kept
Acrochordus snakes long-term. Notice: the Past tense of: HAVE!
Strangely, None of them happen to be ""Currently"" keeping
them. Always--Past Tense! Hmmm, I'll leave You to Your Own
Conclusions on that one. Just Beware of the ""Claims"" out there.
Follow the path that You feel is Best--but base it upon Research and,
White Spot Fungus? Its caused
by Stress and, basically, it appears to be a break-down in the skins ability to
protect the animal from the Outside World, eventually leading to Secondary
Infections that lead to the demise of the snake. There is No ""Magical"" Bacteria
that Your snake was or was not exposed to in the wild--these snakes die in captivity
from White spot all over the world--including captivity in Asia that contains
water from their own natural environments. Improper Shipping is not the sole
source of White Spot, Skin Blister, Whatever. Animals that Arrive in Your hands
""Clean"" Will develop White Spot if Housed Improperly and
Will die from it if the Husbandry Parameters are not Corrected.
Wild-caught, Captive Born, Captive Bred and Born--doesn't matter. Tolerance is
the only difference between these animals--Environmental Imprints on their
brain. Captive Bred and Born babies are always at least a bit easier then
Captive Born babies. Captive Born babies are always a bit easier than
Wild-Caught babies. Wild-Caught babies are always easier then Wild-Caught
adults. Acrochordus snakes are no different.
If You see White Spot fungus
on Your animal--the First question is: Is it Progressing? If it is, then
You probably need to fix something. If not, then the animal may just be
acclimating (If new or just put into a new setup), or the source of stress was
temporary and has already been corrected. Is it a ""Death Sentence""? No,
definitely Not. So, don't Freak-out and start adding Salt or any of that
other stuff. Don't start ripping the snake out for Salt Baths, Melafix Dips or
any of that non-sense. You will just be ADDING stress. Just
step back and look at the Big Picture. Observe the snake's behavior. Try to
calmly sort out what may be wrong. As stated in the
Javanicus Caresheet: It could be something as simple as Your kid(s) or 150lbs
Rottweiler bouncing around on the wood floor, or the Thumping from Your too cool
Home Entertainment System. White Spot Fungus is just an indicator that let's You
know that the snake is stressing about something. But it can kill
Your snake--if You don't do Your Job.

"Does Turkey offer a model that the Mideast can emulate? avril 13, 2012Posted by Acturca in Moyen Orient, Turquie.
Tags: AKP, Arab Spring, foreign policy, Middle East, Neo-Ottomanism, Nora Fisher Onar, Turkey, Turquie
The Daily Star (Lebanon) April 13, 2012, p. 7 TÃ¼rkÃ§e
By Nora Fisher Onar *
Turkey is often touted as an inspiration for the countries of the rest of the Middle East â€“ a characterization it accepts and pursues. In recent years, Turkish policymakers have worked hard to establish â€œTurkey Inc.â€ as the model of a relatively free, stable and increasingly prosperous Muslim-majority country with great economic and foreign policy leverage. But what does the Turkish experience actually represent for the states of the Arab Middle East? How convincing is Turkey, Inc. â€“ and as a model can it really be emulated?
Perhaps the most attention has been paid to the free and fair rise to power of Turkeyâ€™s Justice and Development Party (AKP), which Islamist movements in Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco and Syria have heralded as a symbol of Muslim majoritarian democracy â€“ even explicitly referencing it in the names and platforms of their own parties, movements and factions. To both domestic and international observers, this might signal that, like the AKP in Turkey, Islamist parties elsewhere do not seek to dismantle their statesâ€™ secular framework â€“ at least for the time being.
But in spite of its appeal to both traditional Islamists and â€œpost-Islamistsâ€ â€“ that is, those who fully reconcile their particular politico-religious commitments with globalization â€“ the Turkish formula may not be replicable. Civil-military relations in Turkey have undergone a double-sided transformation over recent decades. As a consequence of the intermittent censure by the army, political Islamists had to moderate their demands and practices; simultaneously, the Turkish army â€“ accustomed to the barracks and aware that interference in government hurt Turkeyâ€™s international standing â€“ increasingly relied on civilian allies to pursue its agenda vis-Ã -vis the AKP.
Eventually, the military relinquished control of crucial institutions (such as the National Security Council), and the final showdown over control of the presidency in 2007 was fought not with bullets and tanks, but with Web declarations, public rallies and court cases. A similar tipping point regarding civilian control of the state is hardly a foregone conclusion in countries still under transition, where national militaries continue to exert a dominant presence in political life.
Other countries in the Middle East also lack the trajectory that Turkey has followed with regard to its economic development. This is particularly true of the export-driven rise of the middle class that has been experienced by religious constituencies across the Anatolian periphery. Such a trend has underpinned the AKPâ€™s moderation, political success and interregional presence. Indeed, Turkeyâ€™s recent economic trajectory is a central component of its appeal in the Arab world.
Over the past decade, Turkey has tripled its Gross Domestic Product and â€“ excluding a dip to minus-4 percent real growth in 2009 â€“ has managed to ride out the global economic crisis with relative equanimity. Commentators have argued that Turkey may be part of a second tier of rising economic powers (alongside such countries as South Korea, Mexico and Indonesia) that is hot on the heels of the Big Four (Brazil, Russia, India and China).
This holds two implications: On a symbolic level, the Turkish experience (along with that of Indonesia and Malaysia) has dramatically undermined theories of Islamâ€™s incompatibility with modernization, especially in the arena of economic governance. More tangibly, over the past decade Turkey has actively sought out partners for sustainable trade-driven growth in a region that has been long addled by the heady cocktail of oil wealth and chronic underdevelopment.
Although economic partnerships were in no way guided by Turkish concerns for democratic governance â€“ a reality that was attested to by Turkeyâ€™s once cozy ties with authoritarian leaders â€“ they have had unintended consequences with positive implications for political reform. For example, the influx of cheaper, better quality Turkish goods in Syrian markets may have undermined a backbone of President Bashar Assadâ€™s regime: namely the interests of the regimeâ€™s business cronies.
To understand the parameters of Turkeyâ€™s role in the region, we should also acknowledge the sensitivities that have arisen from the Ottoman legacy. Some believe that Ankara seeks to reclaim its historical leadership of the Middle East, the Caucasus and the Balkans, something that can rub interlocutors the wrong way. Hence, Turkish foreign policymakersâ€™ reluctance to employ Ottomanist frames of reference.
However, at the domestic social level in Turkey, there remains a growing receptiveness to self-depiction as the benign heir to the Ottoman Empire. This is evident in the proliferation of cultural commodities that employ Ottoman referents. That is the case of the recent record-grossing film â€œConquest 1453,â€ about what Western historiography calls the â€œfallâ€ of Constantinople. In the film, Mehmet the Conqueror â€“ played by an actor who bears a remarkable resemblance to a young Recep Tayyip Erdogan â€“ is shown to be a forceful and compassionate protector of Muslims and Christians alike (though there is no mention in the film of Jews). The image of Turkey as a â€œbig brotherâ€ to downtrodden Muslims in such places as Palestine, Nagorno-Karabakh, Kosovo, and Bosnia-Herzegovina â€“ characterizes an emerging â€œneo-Ottomanistâ€ national image that seems to drive Turkish aspirations of regional leadership within the country and amplify Erdoganâ€™s profile abroad. Whether this is a matter of hubris or of genuine capacity remains to be seen.
A final component that is crucial for evaluating Turkeyâ€™s example is that the country has yet to develop a framework for meaningful multiethnic, multisectarian co-habitation. Mounting violence on the part of militant Kurds and the Turkish stateâ€™s heavy-handed response has fueled hostility between ordinary citizens.
For instance, recent court rulings suggest that vigilante terror toward prominent members of the Armenian and Alevi communities is permissible and will go unpunished. Disturbing numbers of journalists, scholars, and students who have expressed critical views on these fronts have been jailed. There is also deep concern in constituencies that embrace secular lifestyles that recent reforms in fields such as education will yield an ever more restricted Turkish society.
Given the need to put its own house in order and the fact that inter-communal tensions across the Middle East are likely to become worse before becoming better, Turkeyâ€™s AKP government must take very seriously its mandate to write a new and inclusive Constitution. In the longer tem, Turkey must confront the standing challenge of the region â€“ learning to live together despite differences â€“ a challenge which also happens to be Turkeyâ€™s own.
At the end of the day, the export of Turkey, Inc. needs stable and predictable conditions in which trade and investment can thrive; hence, the commitment to the â€œzero problemsâ€ policy that Turkey employed with neighbors in its economic and foreign agendas over the past decade. Due to last yearâ€™s upheavals in the Arab world, however, this policy is unsustainable. Once well-placed to broker a dialogue between Iran and Israel, Turkey is now more alienated from both countries than before as the two nemeses lock horns in what Graham Allison has called the â€œCuban missile crisis in slow motion.â€
Should Israeli-Iranian antagonism spill over into war, the delicate balance in Iraq may unravel into protracted sectarian and ethnic conflict, just as Syriaâ€™s brewing civil war may spill over into neighboring Lebanon. But even without an Israeli-Iranian showdown and an intensified conflagration in Iraq and Syria, Turkeyâ€™s Kurdish question is, quite literally, kindling awaiting a flame, as attested to by recent clashes during Nevruz, or Nowruz, celebrations. All of this suggests that Turkeyâ€™s aspirations to regional leadership are tactically dependent on forestalling an Iranian-Israeli showdown â€“ an end to which it should leverage all its diminished diplomatic capital in the two countries and in partnership with the United States.
Before the AKP came to power and the Arab Awakening broke out, the received wisdom was that when it came to Islam, democracy and secularism, one could have any two but never all three. Similarly, doubts have long been expressed about whether political and economic liberalism can thrive simultaneously in a Muslim-majority setting. Taken together, it seems that if the purveyors of Turkey, Inc. can show that liberal economics goes hand-in-hand with liberal democracy in a country that is governed by pious Muslims, then the Turkish model-in-progress may achieve fruition and offer a timely example for the Middle East.

"Serving diverse populations has never been a strong suit of the health-care system in general; there are huge disparities in the quality of care between whites and African Americans and Hispanics. The law calls for expanded initiatives to increase racial and ethnic diversity in the health-care profession, as well as improved cultural competency. But this will take time. Meanwhile, the existing force of health-care providers will have to adopt a more multicultural mindset -- and that includes increased multicultural intelligence in marketing communications.
Insurance companies will face a different set of challenges. The law stipulates that by 2014 states must set up exchanges through which consumers can directly purchase health insurance, and all legal residents will be required to obtain insurance or pay a penalty. That will likely force a change in the traditional model of marketing health insurance from B2B to a more consumer-oriented approach.
Several major insurers already are adding retail locations and kiosks in shopping malls, as well as sponsoring health fairs, The Miami Herald reports. Humana, for example, is offering its members a 5% savings at Walmart stores on purchases of fresh fruits, vegetables and other products that carry the retailer's ""Great For You"" label. Though many of the newly insured will be eligible for subsidized health insurance through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, to be successful, insurance companies, like providers, will need to be ready to address the unique needs of a very different demographic than what they are used to.
Then there are the pharmaceutical companies. According to Gregg DiPietro, in a blog for Pharm Exec, before the new health-care law, ""pharma built its positioning platform almost entirely on two dimensions: efficacy and safety."" He adds, ""With the approval of the health care law, the conversation has moved ... to one of overall 'value.' ... Efficacy and safety ... are not enough to carry a product's positioning platform.""
Dorothy Wetzel, former VP-consumer marketing at Pfizer, offers five questions in a recent blog that any pharmaceutical brand needs to ask itself when considering beefing up its efforts to multicultural consumers:
What is the size of the business opportunity?
Do multicultural patients approach health issues differently than the general-market patients in their disease state?
- Do the current messages in your communications resonate with the multicultural patient?
- Does your current media and tactical plan reach the multicultural patient?
- Are there organizations that could help accelerate access and the impact of your efforts?
""You can't standardize diversity and say that all of our diverse populations need this,"" says Russell Bennet, Vice President of Latino Health Solutions at United Healthcare. ""Each population may need different things.""
If we are to count ourselves among the great nations of the world, then Americans have a moral imperative to increase the quality of health care for all. As multicultural marketers, we can help. There is a need to educate about disparities. There is a need to get the word out to medically underserved folks as to how they can take best advantage of the new health-care options. And there is clearly a need for more research that looks into the impact of race, ethnicity and sexual orientation on how one navigates -- and is navigated -- through the health-care system.
Perhaps the greatest challenge faced by advertisers will be to make Americans -- in and out of the health-care profession -- aware that we do indeed have a disparities problem. A study conducted last year found that only 59% of Americans were aware of racial and ethnic disparities in health care. Before the ad industry takes on this issue -- and it's a tough one, given the current political climate -- its first job will be to educate health-care providers as well as the general public. Once that 's accomplished, the industry can tackle the challenge of how best to reach multicultural patients as important consumers.",<urn:uuid:00c459a3-0bdd-4cd0-b1a8-2f1a0d1c8fa4>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://adage.com/article/the-big-tent/health-care-law-poses-multicultural-marketing-challenges/237911/,2013-05-18T06:50:43Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.956773341,782,,,,,

Eleanor Constance (Ella) Greenham (1874-1957), medical practitioner, was born on 15 April 1874 at Ipswich, Queensland, second child and only daughter of John Greenham, an English-born draper, and his wife Eleanor, nÃ©e Johnstone, from Ireland. John later established a general store, Greenhams Pty Ltd, in the business centre at Ipswich. Ella attended Ipswich Central Girls' and Infants' School then Brisbane Girls' Grammar School, where she won the English and the natural history prizes. On 1 February 1892 she was the first pupil to be enrolled at Ipswich Girls' Grammar School. There she won the silver medal for the top girl in science and four other prizes. Passing the senior public examination next year and winning six more prizes, she proceeded to advanced studies for university entrance.
In 1895 Greenham went to Women's College within the University of Sydney (M.B., Ch.M., 1901), entering the faculty of arts as a necessary preliminary to her medical studies. She was the first Queensland-born woman to graduate in medicine. Registered to practise in Brisbane on 2 May 1901 as medical practitioner no.711, she began work as resident medical officer at the Lady Bowen Hospital, Brisbane, probably becoming the first woman to receive a residential position in a Queensland hospital. Choosing to work in private practice, in 1903 she took rooms in City Chambers, Queen and Edward Streets, Brisbane, moving in 1907 to 284 Edward Street. Although she met opposition from some male colleagues, her bright personality and attentive care gradually attracted patients and she built up a successful practice.
Greenham was dedicated to her profession and, like many early medical women, she did not marry. She was an accomplished pianist, enjoyed attending the theatre and visiting flower shows and was described as 'a large lady, fond of flowing, floral garments'; at the lady mayoress's 'At Home' in 1904 she wore an Assam silk gown and a hat of blue chiffon. One of the earliest women car-owners in Queensland, she drove a Darracq in 1907 and later a Hupmobile. Indeed, she became a shareholder in the Hupmobile agency, Evers Motor Co. Ltd, Brisbane. She also became chairman of directors of Greenhams Pty Ltd.
In 1945 the Queensland Medical Women's Society elected her to honorary membership for her contribution to women's health and in 1953 she was made honorary member of the British Medical Association (Queensland Branch) for fifty years uninterrupted membership. In her eightieth year she retired to 85 Oxlade Drive, New Farm, but she continued to treat her old patients.
Greenham was a pioneer and a skilful, caring doctor. By her persistence and expertise, she swept away difficulties and opposition, helping to shape the future for women in medicine in Queensland. She died on 31 December 1957 at New Farm and was cremated with Anglican rites.

"Now, I don't know if anyone else has thought of this already, but I have a new gusset option for my britches pattern. I'm super excited. While I love my original gusset, it's roominess and the fact that you can knit from the legs up, I'm smitten with this new gusset. It is very very easy knit and still allows for a nice wide leg, though it only works for the top-down version (I'll figure it out bottom-up some day, the concept is in my head, I just haven't done it yet). I'm putting the finishing touches on the directions and will release it tomorrow to everyone who is on the britches yahoo group.
Also, I am revamping the whole pattern. Better pictures, more options, clarified wording on some directions that were ambiguous before. I'm adding a ""no options, just the basics"" beginner pattern that I'm hoping will be a great how-to-knit-longies for a new knitter. Since Adorabubble Britches has been out almost a year now (boy, does time fly), I've gotten lots of feedback, many great questions from beginners and suggestions that will be incorporated into this pattern. Since it is just the basics, I will be offering the beginner pattern for just $4. It will be seperate from the whole Adorabubble Britches pattern, but will come with a coupon for a discount on the big Adorabubble Britches pattern. So, if you like the beginner pattern and want all the options later, you won't have to fork over a ton :-)
I'm also hard at work on the sideways britches pattern, though this one is a little further away from completion than the others. And yes, a soaker pattern is in the future.

"When I was little I watched over and over â€” really, I truly, truly loved it â€” a Masterpiece Theater about three sisters who every night would go to a magical ball, only after the castle is completely asleep. To get to the ball, a porthole opened in their room that led to an enchanted, snow-covered wood and a river, which they crossed on rowboats guided by the three male princes. Every morning, their mother would wake them up and groan over how difficult it was to get the girls out of bed, and every week a maid would grimace over how they had worn out their best dancing slippers. Something was afoot, but they could not name it.
I could look up the plot â€” but it isnâ€™t the truth that matters to me now, itâ€™s the story in my head. Next: the parents suspected the daughters of something terrible, something grave, and so locked them in their room; but of course, the girls could still reach the porthole, which was within it. Held to questioning, one of the sisters told of the magical ball. To prove it, she brought back a branch of silvery pine and held it out to her father saying Look, look, itâ€™s real â€” the trees, the lake, the dancing, and the princes who take us. Here is a metonymy for you, a length of wood.
But maybe what happened was that walking, she was snagged in the tree, her dress hitched, and they found, entangled in her silks the next day, a branch.
In any case I had not thought of the story for so long. In the end, only the best sister â€” pure, for some reason that the others are not â€” marries a magical prince. Perhaps the others are tattle-tales, who give it away. Perhaps they choose the life of reality over the one of fiction.
When I thought of the story today for the first time in years I thought, of course: here is a lesson to parents about raising teenage girls; or here is a lesson to teenage girls about sleeping around, about letting boys into your bedrooms: You will be caught, snagged. You will grasp for him and find only a branch, as evidence. Here is a eulogy for the high schoolers heading out to parties in Potomac, who crash their SUVs on River Road and kill themselves and all their riders â€” this is the fairy tale for them, who live forever in silent rowboats on dark water, captained by strangers who promise in the distance a glimmering ball.
I think also it is a parable for dreams, which you can never prove with props or worn-out shoes; and of course as well a parable for romance, which comes to us at night, and wears off in the strange light of the morning; or maybe a parable for love â€” for the sister who found it â€” for it comes to us at first through a fiction as if of our own making â€” itâ€™s our thoughts of him, at first, that woo us. And itâ€™s when youâ€™ve got to prove it, youâ€™ve got to find the branch or not find the branch, you may find that you have nothing at all as evidence; or you might find that you are caught there, and can never row back, and that your sisters â€” beautiful as they had seemed to you, then â€” are now forever collapsed into their own world and that your father, glaring down at you, holds none of his angry power; the world of the dream has become potent, the daytime world of slippers and lace is stupid, stupid as a fairy tale, stupid as a place you leave. The real is now the dream you thought you had invented, and you see it in all of its crisp textures.
Anyway, now I only pity the maid. Repairer of shoes, commiserator with those whose happiness can be found only in double worlds.",<urn:uuid:a3ecf41f-7f0f-4796-8926-998860bcc2b5>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://adrianeq.tumblr.com/post/29441837115/angela-carter-esque-thoughts,2013-05-18T06:59:46Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.981864572,826,,,,,
"A land whose rich cultural heritage is discovered not only from within the walls of numerous museums, galleries and churches, many of which today, as zero category monuments are included in a part of the UNESCO World Heritage List, but also in that magical place on the Mediterranean, where even the shortest stroll becomes a journey down a staircase thousands of years old, which takes one through a history that is at the same time turbulent, exciting and glorious.
With as many as seven cultural phenomena- The Festivity of Saint Blaise, lace-making in Lepoglava, Hvar and Pag, the bell ringers from the Kastav region, the Hvar Procession Za KriÅ¾em, (â€˜following the Crossâ€™), two-part singing in the Istrian scale, in Istria and Hrvatsko Primorje, the spring procession of â€˜Ljeljeâ€™ and traditional manufacture of wooden toys in the Hrvatsko zagorje region, Croatia is among the countries with the most protected intangible cultural heritage elements, recorded on the UNESCO List.

From time immemorial, the tie has been a part of the Croatian national costume, which was preserved by the Croats to the more recent times, who moved to central Europe in the 16th century. It was later taken over by the Croatian soldiers who were fighting in Europe, and a part of their uniform was assumed by the French in the 17th century. Under the leadership of the French â€žGod of Sun"" Louis XIV there was a horsemen unit, the so-called Royal cravate, who wore mostly red collar ribbons. The custom of wearing ribbons from the Croats dates back to this time, which was later expanded around Europe and the world, and today is inevitably the most important detail in men's fashion, and also an original Croatian souvenir. The word Â«kravataÂ» (tie) originates from the word Â«KroateÂ»...

Red-white coat of arms
Recognizable all over the world, and related only to Croats - characteristic cube-shaped red-white coat of arms which is believed to originate from the Persian original homeland of Croats (red signifies south and white signifies north). That is where the name for two Croatias derives from, i.e. White in north and Red in south. When the Croats have selected Ferdinand Habsburg to be their King in Cetine in 1527, they confirmed that choice with some seals, and one of them was Croatian coat of arms, but with 64 fields, i.e. the complete chess-board. That is where the popular term â€žÅ¡ahovnica"" derives from, and Å ah (chess) in Persian means the Ruler - Tsar.
Did you know that there is a world rarity in the Archeological museum in Zagreb? Of course, we are talking about the Zagreb mummy.

Great jacket for a great price
Carhartt makes a great product. This is my fourth Carhartt jacket/coat. Yes this jacket is a little short, but thats why its listed as a jacket and not a coat. When buying online you need to research the product thoroughly. It especially helps if you visit the manufacture website. This was my first buying experience with Altrec.com and it has been very pleasant. Great jacket! Just what I wanted and at the price. Thanks Altrec!!

Another fine Carhart product. Purchased a large and I wear a 42 regular, this jacket fits just right. Not too heavy, not too light. Well built and comfortable right out of the package. Just what I was looking for, and got it for the best price on the web. Thanks you Altrec!

So looks like everyone got a good soaking of rain. Anyones gear kept them 100% dry (minus pants from water crossings)? Did KLIM/gortex stand up?
Great report btw!
I think (guys?) we were all drenched through to our underwear. On the pic with the barmaid my T-shirt is still wet-and that's about 3 hours after we arrived. This is no criticism of the gear-eventually it just soaked down from the neck. The rain was torrential and unceasing, and we were riding through lots of deep standing water as well as the river crossings.
I don't think anything would have kept it out.",<urn:uuid:348a8b60-c9ba-475c-8118-6e2336606dd0>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://advrider.com/forums/showpost.php?p=20369784&postcount=2049,2013-05-18T06:21:18Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.990560055,148,,,,,
"Thereâ€™s no doubt of my affections for the Rich Eisen Podcast (REP). I listen to it every week and over the years itâ€™s easily become my favorite NFL related iPod listens. Itâ€™s the perfect combination of everything NFL and pop culture so if thatâ€™s right up your alley then this is the podcast for you.
So it was a very pleasant surprise when I saw that this weekâ€™s episode had NFL Networkâ€™s Rich Eisenâ€™s sit down with St. Louis Rams head coach and NFL Competition Committee member Jeff Fisher for the REPâ€™s Combine Special.
They chat about Coach Fisherâ€™s first year in St. Louis, the NFL scouting combine, and a few other important Rams topics.
Rich Eisen: How do you rank your first year in St. Louis?
It wasnâ€™t a rebuilding yearâ€¦ It was not good enough from our standpoint. We lost games that we had a chance to win early on and throughout the season.
We learned a lot. Thatâ€™s the thing I think is so good about what happened. Our young team learned a lot and we have to learn not to let those things happen again.
Itâ€™s a real fun team to coach and to win a game on the road was a weird experience because they hadnâ€™t done it in a while.
Our division is an outstanding division. Arizona came to St. Louis undefeated (in week five). We forget about that at the beginning. It was quite a challenge for us and we were proud of the way they played.
(I love that Coach Fisher isnâ€™t satisfied. Despite taking a 2-14 team to 7-8-1 in one season he did not mention specific records in the interview. I think most coaches would hung their hat on that sort of improvement. But not Coach Fisher. He just saw that the team is improving and growing towards getting better.)
Rich Eisen: â€œ(James) Laurinaitis and Chris Long came to the set after the game. They said that it had been a very long time since they had played a game with a camera hovering over the middle of the field and the whole country watching. In the end, they were enjoying staying on the set so much Deion asked them to leave. But you could see how much joy they were taking in these moments.â€
Itâ€™s hard you know. No team in a five year span in the history of the NFL lost more games than our organization prior to last year. Winning games is what itâ€™s all about. We won a few and then we had one team in particular that took us ten quarters to beat.
Itâ€™s funny because you go through that tie experience. But then you play them three weeks later and youâ€™re going to guarantee thereâ€™s no way thatâ€™s going to happen again. â€¦ And we were two minutes away from that happening again.
(I was at that game and stayed after to see Laurinaitis and Long hang out on the set. They were having a great time and most of all I think they were happy for Rams fans.)
Rich Eisen: â€œThat was unbelievable. People maybe for the next decade having trouble dealing with Colin Kaepernick will have your team to blame. Because it was your team that knocked Alex Smith out of the game and ushering in the whole Kaepernick-ness of it all.â€
Sorry about that. I would think the 49er fans are also Rams fans at heart.
(They can specifically thank Rams LB Jo-Lonn Dunbar and maybe DT Michael Brockers. We believe that it was a combination of Dunbar and Brockerâ€™s hits on Alex Smith in week 10 that ultimately started the Colin Kaepernick era in San Francisco. And no sir. Thereâ€™s no way any 49ers fans would ever admit to being Rams fans at heart.)
Rich Eisen: â€œWhere do you stand on the whole subject on (Cam Newton, RG3, Colin Kaepernick type) quarterbacks and where offenses are going?â€
Well, weâ€™ve got Carolina this year so weâ€™re going to see that offense five times. So weâ€™ve got work to do as everybody else does. And it doesnâ€™t mean to say that another one is not going to pop up someplace. Thatâ€™s the challenge of the NFC West is the mobility at the quarterback position. The pistol, the read-option whatever you call it.
The NFC East has their own new challenge in Philadelphia with the high tempo. The game changes and youâ€™re forced to adjust on both sides of the ball. Defensively we have to adjust.
Rich Eisen: â€œWhat do you think Bradford needs to do to take a step into that elite class?â€
How about have his second year in the same offensive system? Because this will be the first time heâ€™ll be able to experience that. Last year our offense was his third offense in three years.
We need to surround him with better people. He can make all the throws. Heâ€™s an outstanding deep ball thrower. He has more mobility than people think. He can run for first downs and do that kind of stuff.
We can do a better job of keeping him upright. We did that as we moved through the season and minimized the hits. We need to get some better people. We are working at that.
(Is Brian Schottenheimerâ€™s offense the best fit for Bradford? I donâ€™t know for sure but giving Bradford another year in the same system is a good way to figure it out. More importantly it sounds like the Rams are serious about getting Bradford the weapons he needs to have that break out season. â€œBetter peopleâ€ is a very broad term but Iâ€™m hoping it means solidifying the offensive line. That should be their number one priority.)
Rich Eisen: â€œWhat about Steven Jackson? Is he one of those people?â€
Hope so. We are in the middle of that. Steven is out of the country and we are talking to his agent. Weâ€™d love for him to have a chance to finish his career with us.
(I read this as â€œWeâ€™d love to have Jack back but not at the $7 million dollar 2013 price tag.â€ Coach Fisher keeps talking about his young team and Iâ€™m not convinced that Jack is going to be a part of that youth movement. The Rams have Isaiah Pead, Daryl Richardson and Terrance Ganaway waiting in the wings.)
Rich Eisen: â€œMoving forward what are you hoping to get out of this combine? You saw some kids last year that you drafted that made some immediate impact.â€
Jenks (Janoris Jenkins), Tru (Trumaine Johnson), Chris Givens and Daryl Richardsonâ€¦
What you get out of this is youâ€™ve got to aggressively attack the interview process. Get as much information as you can, ask as many questions as you can, and then hopefully weâ€™re going to get enough guys participate where youâ€™d be able to look and see some athletic ability.
We have a pretty good sense of the strengths of this draft. We have a good sense of what we need. Weâ€™re either going to do with these guys out here or we are going to try and do it through free agency.
(Strengths of this draft include safeties, linebackers, and on both sides on the line. Which is great news for the Rams since they need some starters as well as depth in those positions. Mike Mayock of NFL Network believes there isnâ€™t really that Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III, Luke Kuechly-type star player in the first round of the draft. He said the number 20-25 picks in the draft are just as good as the number 5-10 picks. The Rams could be getting some great players with the 16th and 22nd picks in the first round.)
(Another quick note: Last yearâ€™s draft was orchestrated by General Manager Les Snead and Coach Fisher but they were using information put together by the previous regimeâ€™s scouting staff. For this Aprilâ€™s draft Snead will have intelligence gathered by his own people. This can only make things better, right?)
Update from @Shields3L â€“ Most of the scouting staff is still the same from last yr. Only 3 guys gone. (Thanks for the info, Tim.)
Rich Eisen and Coach Fisher continue their conversation changing their focus to what was being discussed by the competition committee which Coach Fisher is a part of. Especially fun was listening to Rich Eisen campaign to get rid of his pet peeve, the Tuck Rule.

"Here is my progress on the Oklahoma Backroads workshop that I took with Bonnie Hunter last week. I have 20 blocks complete...only 100 or so more to go! :P
One idea Bonnie presented was ""bonus triangles."" This isn't a new idea to me, but it's one that I was never too excited about. It seemed to take a lot of extra time (it does)...and I wasn't sure the time and effort would be worth it.
She pointed out that a couple of her quilts in her newest book ""Scraps & Shirtails 2"" were made almost entirely from these bonus triangles. Hmmm...that had my interest a little more. She also shared a way to make those triangles a size that plays well with other size squares and rectangles. I decided I'd give it a try for this project since I would be making a large amount of those ""half"" flying geese blocks above.
I'm going to show you the technique for making 2"" unfinished triangles from a 2.5"" unfinished flying geese unit. First, find a business card that is 2"" high and cut a 2"" square from one side.
Next cut the square on the diagonal to make two triangles.
Now draw TWO lines on your 2.5"" square...one down the center and one with the business card triangle place in the corner. (click image for a closer view)
Sew along both lines...I sew just inside the center line for better results....
Cut between the two sewn lines. Don't fret about the smaller seam allowance! According to Bonnie, it's going to be okay!! The seam is sewn...it's not going to come apart or anything. If you sew 1/2"" away from the center line (in order to have 1/4"" seam allowance), you'll end up with a HST that is about 1 3/4""...and that dimension doesn't play well with anything else!
Press both pieces and viola!
Before long, you'll have a pile of HST like this! This isn't even all of them....
Look what I made from 90 bonus triangles!! This is the Quilt Square Quilt Along block for April. How perfect is that? My block is a little bigger than the pattern, because my triangles are bigger, but I think that's okay, right? I love it. I added a small border and I'm going to finish it for a pretty table topper. Or maybe I want it to be a wall hanging? Hmm....decisions, decisions....

"Eventually, new multiplexes such as the Arclight and the Grove opened nearby and began nabbing the artful specialty films that had long been the Sunset 5â€™s exclusive domain.When a small business closes in the face of competition from larger firms, it's common to hear complaints about the capitalist system -- along with calls for subsidies or government protection (such as having the location designated a ""historical landmark""). So I was pleasantly surprised to read the next line:
Such is the forward motion of time and commerce.I appreciate and respect the owners' choice to accept the theater's fate with equanimity.
For those worried about the lack of venues for independent films, two things: First, as the quote above indicates, the Arclight and Grove theaters were able to squeeze out the Laemmle Sunset 5 in part because they offered independent fare in addition to the usual major-studio movies. And second, the Sunset 5 has been acquired by Robert Redford's Sundance Cinemas, which is currently renovating the theater. As Tom Bernard, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, says in the linked article: ""Maybe fresh blood will bring new life into the theater and come new cash too. A face lift on the theater may attract new audiences and make it a place to be."" Only time will tell.
UPDATE (added immediately after posting): Before anybody says it, I should point out that the Laemmle family will do just fine. They have other theaters, including new ones opening elsewhere in the L.A. area. Obviously, it would be harder for someone who owned only one location to greet the news with such equanimity. Nevertheless, I respect how the Laemmles responded. Moreover, the usual calls for subsidy and protection don't just come from the small business owners, but from people who have an interest in the business, including suppliers (like indie producers) and devoted customers. I'm pleased that apparently didn't happen here.",<urn:uuid:dc9c6a36-fb91-4ecb-9d4b-5029ec8c2eb5>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://agoraphilia.blogspot.com/2012/07/grace-in-face-of-change.html,2013-05-18T06:44:06Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.972042322,404,,,,,
". . . for it remains true that those things which make us human are, curiously enough, always close at hand.

"Saturday, May 29, 2010
Jim, my personal library, recently gave me an American classic: ""The Making of the President: 1960"" by Theodore H. White.
The book chronicles Teddy White's experiences along the campaign trail with Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The writing is outstanding and the insights are second to none. There are countless political observations that are as true today as they were 50 years ago. However, none of those are what stand out for me. There are two paragraphs that are extremely eerie though the power of retrospection.
The first is on Page 372, when talking about Kennedy and The Oval Office: ""When the windows are closed, the sound of Washington traffic, which hums as it passes by outside, is entirely locked out, and one is reminded that these windows are three inches thick of laminated glass, thick enough to stop an assassin's rifle bullet from beyond the grounds -- if the assassin gets time enough to sight.""
The other disturbing reference is to a day in the life of John F. Kennedy. On page 375, Teddy White wrote: ""Then the supreme and somber problem of war and peace: a long meeting of one and one quarter hours in the cabinet room with Secretary of State Dean Rusk; Secretary of National Defense Robert S. McNamara; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Lyman Lemnitzer; Admiral Harry D. Felt, Commander-in-Cheif, Pacific theatre; two personal advisers McGeorge Bundy and Walter Rostow; and Vice-President of the United States Lyndon B. Johnson. Here at this meeting he considered, not for the first time but for the decisive [Whit's italics, not mine] time, American response to the newest thrust of Communist pressure on the changing world -- the movement of Communist guerillas over the jungles and ridges of Southeast Asia into the formless Kingdom of Laos. Could anything be done there, and if it could, should anything be done there? This was the ugliest of problems; and if his decisions were right the meeting would fade into history as unimportant; but if the decisions brought war, then this, indeed, was where the Americans chose war.""
I think we can say that the president decided wrong that day.",<urn:uuid:0b410f0f-8b17-4f80-9b51-77574c2ef7cb>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://ahoyhanoi.blogspot.com/2010_05_29_archive.html,2013-05-18T07:12:43Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.964527011,468,,,,,
"According to a recent Aquatics International survey, nearly half of the respondents are operating pools that have been in business for at least 20 years. Thatâ€™s the case at Northwest Branch Pool in Silver Springs, MD. Built nearly 50 years ago, NWB pool has some serious maintenance issues and operators have started a campaign to raise funds to make the necessary (expensive!) repairs.
Do you have an older pool? What serious maintenance issues have you experienced? Were you able to fund the necessary repairs or have you had to put off work because there was no money in the budget for a proper fix? How did you ensure that the pool was safe?
Yes, the pool I ran is from 1941, and has always few maintenance issues but is open 364 days a year!
The last 10 years what we did:
Change filtration system
Change pump and motor for a variable speed motor
New Chlorine generator
Installed PV solar panels to generate energy...200 ,000 Kw/h saved!
Fixed part of the deck
New office recently done
Need to be done:
Resourface the pool again...on the budget for next year.
Renovation of locker rooms...hopelly in next few years.
Purchase UV system(wish).
How we do it?
With partenership with the local goverment, our city.
With donations and fundraising.

"I've always been vocal about being ""proudly Pinoy"". I shared here in my blog a few months ago Why I Wanna Stay Home and I still do because I know I have a mission to accomplish here.
Anyway, Marc tagged me for the meme, ""What are the 3 signs you see happening now that make you say, â€œit feels great to be Pinoyâ€ then tag ten (10) of your blogger friends."" Here are my 3 reasons:
1. Pinky David, Licensing Director of Discovery Channel in her keynote address for the 38th Marketing Conference this morning quoted Tony Meloto's speech for a Gawad Kalinga event, ""Filipinos, you were created for excellence..."". That gave me the shivers and I remember my Kuya sharing to me that GK will indeed manage to build 700K+ homes within 7 years and it will drastically lessen the poverty rate in the Philippines. And, guess what, GK is already reaching out to other countries and working with the UN to eradicate poverty as well in other countries. The secret to the success of the program? Pinoys.
2. Filipinos give care and help in healing people. Did you know that 40% of nurses in New York hospitals are supposedly Pinoys? (I got that statistic from a friend.) Who'd give the TLC that patients and children need if there weren't Pinoys?
3. Filipinos are very talented and creative people. Guess who sings at bars all over Asia? Guess what Pizza Hut ad actually contributed to the boom of the 1-800 numbers (now sing it - nine-one-one-one-one-one-one!? Guess who are the best animators in the world (remember that bahay kubo in Nemo's aquarium? And who does the best non-American ""American accent"" in the whole wide BPO industry? PINOYS!
God loves us. He created us to be excellent, talented, big-hearted, humorous-even-at-adversity people and there are actually foreigners applying for Filipino citizenship! Imagine that.
And I am just simply so PROUD to be FILIPINO!

"Chinese domestic production of civil helicopters is set to grow, but not as quickly as the countryâ€™s authorities predict, according to a local market analyst. Matthieu Devoisselle, co-founder of Avia-Tek, a Shanghai-based aerospace consultancy firm specializing in emerging countries, regards government forecasts as unrealistic. But Chinese manufacturer Avicopter does have reason to be optimistic, he adds.
AÃ©rospatiale Super Frelon
The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) certified the countryâ€™s â€œnewâ€ home-grown heavy-lift helicopter on January 9. Built at state-owned Avic, the AC313 tips the scales at 27,600 pounds, can carry up to 27 people and has a maximum ferry range of 485 nm and a service ceiling near 28,000 feet. The AC313 appears to be an outgrowth of the 14,000-pound Chinese Zhi-8. That medium helicopter is based on the 1970s-vintage AÃ©rospatiale SA321 Super Frelon.
Yesterday, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) certified the countryâ€™s â€œnewâ€ homegrown heavy-lift helicopter, the AC313. It tips the scales at 27,600 pounds, can carry up to 27 people and has a maximum ferry range of 560 miles and service ceiling of nearly 28,000 feet. The helicopter was built by state-owned Avic, the same company that recently made Chinese-market Sikorsky S-76 airframes under contract.
China is expected to modify its low-altitude airspace restrictions over the
next few years, a move that could trigger demand for more than 1,000 new civil helicopters there over the next two decades. Part of its strategy for meeting that demand appears to be leveraging current and future relations with established Western helicopter manufacturers to build its own helicopter industry.
Last week China flew a new home-grown heavy-lift helicopter for the first time. The AC313 tips the scales at 27,600 pounds, can carry up to 27 people, has a maximum ferry range of 560 miles and was built at state-owned AVIC, the same company making Sikorsky S-76C++ airframes. The AC313 appears to be an outgrowth of the 14,000-pound Chinese Zhi-8. That medium helicopter is based on the 1970s-vintage AÃ©rospatiale SA321 Super Frelon.
Safranâ€™s helicopter subsidiary Turbomeca could be back in the contest to provide the powerplant for the Z15 helicopter following Chinaâ€™s recent decision to re-evaluate the engine. Late last year, executives with Eurocopterâ€™s EC 175 program indicated that discussions are under way for the possible launch of a new engine for the Chinese version of the medium twin.
The Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC) is generally seen as the next big market for the helicopter industryâ€“OEMs, operators, training schools and maintenance operations alike. But can we expect the skies over China to be black with whirling blades any time soon?",<urn:uuid:6536e7e9-d402-4cf1-923b-8ee387642bfb>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://ainonline.com/social-tags/a%C3%A9rospatiale-super-frelon,2013-05-18T07:24:30Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.931336045,646,,,,,

|College Teams||High Schools|
May 24, 2012Auburn heads into the 2012 season looking for better production defensively, and the Tiger coaching staff has brought in the type of players in the past few recruiting classes that are capable of competing at a high level in the SEC.
There is always at least one, if not more, players who come out of nowhere and make a big impact on the season every year. A great example would be Nick Fairley, who jumped onto the scene in a big way in 2010, winning the Lombari Award and playing a big role in Auburn's BCS national championship.
If Auburn is to compete for championships in the near future, the Tigers will need all the depth possible, particularly along the all-important defensive line.
Over the next few days we will be making a list of the most underrated youngsters at each position beginning today with the defensive line.
Justin Delaine (6-foot-5, 280 pounds, Sophomore)
Delaine was signed to Auburn as a big-bodied athlete with potential to get bigger, and become a force up front defensively.
The Linden (Ala.) product was very raw when he stepped on Auburn's campus for the first time, but has shown signs of being able to contribute. Delaine has great athleticism blended with great size, and a long, and lanky frame.
Once Delaine learns how to use that frame, he should be able to make some plays for the Tigers going forward. Delaine is very light on his feet to be so big, but doesn't distribute his balance evenly enough, or consistently enough to maintain a strong pass rushing position.
If Delaine can improve his power, along with his balance, Auburn could have a diamond in the rough waiting off the edge.
Keymiya Harrell (6-foot-4, 260 pounds, RS Freshman)
Harrell showed vast improvement after sitting his first season on the plains by way of a redshirt. One of Harrell's biggest problems early on as a true freshman was his ability to attack the blocker, then shed the blocker, and then go make the tackle.
Once Harrell improved his technique, and finally started using his hands to help him, good things began happening.
Auburn still needs more depth up front on defense, especially with rival teams like Alabama and LSU deploying smash mouth offenses.
If Harrell can keep on progressing at his current rate, he should become a very effective hybrid-type defensive lineman.
Jabrian Niles (6-foot-2, 297 pounds, RS Freshman)
Niles did some good things this past spring, even earning mention from defensive line coach Mike Pelton.
However, the redshirt freshman still has a long way to go to become a complete player.
The Mobile (Ala.) product is great at attacking a gap, and then re-directing in the backfield to make a play. His problem at Auburn so far has been getting able to get through that gap to go make the play.
Once Niles gets into position to tackle a ball carrier, he is great at finishing plays. Another dimension Niles brings on the inside, is an above average ability to rush the passer.
Having an inside pass rusher that can create havoc on second, and third and long is a deadly weapon. Look for Niles continue being brought along slowly, but don't be surprised if he gets a few looks this fall.
Tyler Nero (6-foot-2, 290 pounds, Freshman)
Nero is a very mature inside defensive lineman with great character, and uses his hands at the point of attack like an SEC veteran.
Watching Nero is exciting because he is quick, and extremely agile off the ball. Nero has incredible instincts, which make him a very consistent tackler, and a constant threat to force fumbles.
Another great thing about Nero's game is his effort, and it shows in his game tape. There is nothing an offensive lineman hates more than a big guy that never quits.
Gimel President (6-foot-3, 240 pounds, Freshman)
President is a very underrated prospect who will to Auburn this fall, and his offer list coming out of high school shows it. Nearly every recruiter that saw President play last year in high school, saw massive potential due to his athleticism.
President can disrupt the passer, make tackles for loss, and do just nearly everything from multiple positions. The only thing holding President back from being a major blue-chip prospect is his size. President's frame doesn't look to be able to carry much more weight, but he knows how to use what he already has.
Another positive about President is his knowledge of the game, and he should be close to big enough to hold his own against SEC offensive linemen, which is all a player with his talent ceiling needs.",<urn:uuid:322ce5db-df1f-434e-915c-03c198a09164>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://alabama.rivals.com/content.asp?cid=1368505,2013-05-18T06:19:51Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.974762082,1012,,,,,

"Sir Gregory Ander
Sir Gregory Ander was born and bred in Queensland, within view of Hartleigh Castle. Born to middling nobles of Alderclass, Gregory was the last of six boys. His elder brothers followed in their fatherâ€™s footsteps as advocates at Queen Maelysâ€™s Court, but Gregory always sought something a bit more exciting than pushing paper and defending the ruffians in the streets of Hartleigh City.
When he was sixteen, Gregoryâ€™s father arranged for him to be accepted into one of the knighting orders, the Order of the Oak, upon the death of Gregoryâ€™s closest brother, Bram. The Order of the Oak was not the initial choice of the family, for the Order of the Roseâ€“being the Queenâ€™s personal guardâ€“have a great deal more prestige. Regardless, once initiated, Gregory had little say unless the Queen changed her mind or promoted him elsewhere.
Gregory, being both crafty and handsome, quickly rose through the ranks, and was granted full knightship on the even of his twentieth birthday. He was conspicuously late to his knighting, however, having been spotted with a noblewoman some time before. What a messenger knight was doing in the company of such a woman was certainly up for speculation.
It was two weeks later that the very same noblewoman was discovered dead in her apartment. While Sir Ander was no where near the womanâ€™s abode at the time, and therefore could not have been involved directlyâ€“so the advocates from his family argued at courtâ€“he was acquitted of all charges. The advocates on behalf of the womanâ€™s family, Fortesque & Nob, filed an official complaint after the trial, but it was quickly thrown out by the High Counselor herself, having noted that a decision was made and the law would be upheld.
As a messenger knight, Sir Ander is frequently dispatched up and down the Continent, and sometimes across the sea and into the Isles, as well. While his fellow knights are extremely loyal to him, and have only the most glowing comments to make on his behalf, some will tell you different. If you visit some of the seedier establishments in the Territories, for instance, not a few Innkeepers will tell you about the fresh-faced Oaksguard with a penchant for roughing up their girls.
Sir Ander is a man of contradictions. He is young, but jaded; clever, but arrogant; passionate, but cruelâ€“he loves the attentions of women, but cannot stand their company.
When Sir Ander walked into the Territories towns to collect Alderclass girls on an errand from the Queen, he used her writ as absolute law, reportedly threatening violence should the towns not cooperate and hand over their young women. And it is rumored that what violence was seen was due to his command, though it has officially been blamed on an interruption by the Order of the Asp.

The ideal time to consult Alexandraâ€™s House is at the time of diagnosis or loss: a) so parents are fully informed and b) to help alleviate some of the acute anxiety and very common feelings of isolation and abandonment. Alexandraâ€™s House does not charge for its services nor does it accept contributions from people they serve.
Over 90% of our referrals come from the medical community â€“ perinatologists, hospitals, doctorâ€™s offices, sonographers, the community at large and through our website. We have followed families in America as far away as Alaska and have provided assistance in the UK, France, Germany, and New Zealand.
Services include: bringing meaning to suffering, assistance in grief resolution, parent-parent partnering, birth planning, funeral planning, long-term support, one to one and group meetings, pre-natal and post-natal housing, if required. If a baby survives and is dismissed from the hospital, the family and baby can stay here for the duration of their life. Professional nursing services are provided through a licensed hospice agency.
She never opened her eyes but I already knew her eyes sparkled like the night sky. Sophia, born an angel, that God already needed. Her life lasted only a few hours but changed by life forever. Only the best die young. Sophia deserved the life that she will never be able to experience but we will life through her. She made the biggest impact on my life even though she'll never know it.
It was a rainy day. I was at the hospital because my Baby sister was born her name was Sophia. I held her. She was light like a pillow. It was fun. I like it I miss Sophia
We talked to our kids this weekend, and they were so individual, heartbroken and sweet. Our daughter, Annie, said she thought God must have put four seeds inside of me when I was created and one was an angel seed. So I had three babies and now I would have the angel baby. That's the story I am going with from now on because it sounds just perfect to me. Our oldest, Leo, was the most emotional.
Joy and Joya were twins, very special twins. They were joined at the chest and shared one heart. After complex testing prenatally, it was determined that Joy and Joya could not be separated surgically. Neither would survive the surgery.
Ten fingers and ten toes - that's the first thing every parent checks on their newborn. For the parents of Alexandra's House those simple things are not taken for granted.

"Sutter's son, Brandon, returned to the Hurricanes' lineup Wednesday night for the first time since he suffered a concussion against the Islanders on Oct. 25. Sutter said he spoke to Brandon after the game - a 5-1 loss to the Capitals -- and that he was feeling fine.
I asked Sutter if Brandon gave him a scouting report on the Capitals.
""All he said was, 'Ovechkin,Semin and Backstrom-- Wow!""
Those three players are skating on the same line now and Alexander Semin had two goals and three assists Wednesday night.

Boudreau also believes that Fedorov is almost healthy enough to play again.
â€œHe said he was feeling better,â€ says Boudreau. â€œWe kept him off the ice today; heâ€™ll probably be on the ice [Friday]. When we were in Carolina they skated pretty hard. Thatâ€™s why heâ€™s getting an extra dayâ€™s rest [Thursday].â€
The Boston Globe, Nov. 13, 2008:
NYLANDER TO HAWKS?
Rumors abound that the Blackhawks are closing in on a deal with the Capitals to acquire ex-Bruin forward Michael Nylander, 36, who also played here for a couple of seasons. With so many young players in the Blackhawks lineup, Nylander's veteran presence would help. Nylander missed half of last season because of injury, but has been healthy from the start this season, collecting two goals and 9 points . . .
Those rumors don't go away... Even Ted Leonsis lately said in his blog that goaltending is an issue and Bulin is a proven veteran... I don't think Caps will go after Huet after what has happened in the summer...
Update from Capitals Insider:
Michael Nylander, who has only one assist in his past seven games, will be a healthy scratch tonight. Jose Theodore will start in goal and likely face Scott Clemmensen. Sergei Fedorov is also out, as is Shaone Morrisonn.
Corey Masisak reports that Fedorov and Morrison are skating for the first time...

"Is Galaxy Note really too large? size always matters!
Recently, I read so many reviews complaining on the size of Galaxy Note. The resentments include: it is too large; the reviewer cannot operate it with one hand; it looks stupid when you hold it near your ear.
Before I talk anything about these reviews, maybe we can watch the a video of Steve Ballmer commenting iPhone in 2007. In the interview, he actually was laughing at iPhone â€œMicrosoft is selling Millions of millions of millions a year..Apple zero â€ Entertaining? Here is the video:
Maybe we can watch another video of this same Steve Ballmer commenting iPad in 2010. Again, he was totally unimpressed by iPad at all. â€œLaptops actually are well designed for a lot of things. I notice they are all light. In fact, if you look around this room, they all weigh zero pounds, because theyâ€™re just sitting on the table, you are not holding them and you donâ€™t set them up when you want to type, and they prop up â€” they have good attributes.â€
So, when I read the complaints on the size of Galaxy Note, it reminds me about this M$ guy.
Think out of the box. The reviewers concerning the dimension of galaxy Note are just a bunch of Steve Ballmers.
Why smartphone should be operated by one-hand? You get two hands! You get used to using one hand, because the phones you are using does not need two hands.
When you strain your eyeballs on the 3.5â€ LCD screen, is it comfortable to get a 5.3â€³ Super AMOLED?
When you use your fat and dirty finger on the tiny screen (is it for Gorilla?), is it more elegant to use a S-Pen on a larger display?
Why are you so cared about othersâ€™ eyes when you hold this phone near your ear? Are you are super star? Are they really care about you? No, for sure.
I like this phone because of its size.

"Abuja â€” The Federal Executive Council (FEC) yesterday ruled that any aircraft above 20 years will not be allowed to fly the country's air spaces.
Such aircraft are also not to be imported into the country as part of measures for promoting safety within the country's airspace.
Minister of Aviation, Fidelia Njezeh told State House correspondents after the FEC meeting which was presided over by President Goodluck Jonathan that the Federal Government was also embarking on the remodelling of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA) and the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA), Abuja.
On the age of aircraft age and maintenance, she said ""we have an existing policy on the age of aircraft. Any aircrafts that will be imported into the country must not be more than 20 years old, and we have maintained that policy. None of the aircraft in our air space is above 20 years old"".
""We also have a policy on maintenance of the aircraft. NCAA is charged with ensuring that all aircraft are well maintained and their spare parts are always available. So we have not compromised in the area of safety and maintenance of our aircraft,"" she stated.
According to her, government was doing all within its powers to up grade the facility at the two major airports in the country.
""We all know that our airports have outlived their shelve life, so to say. They are obsolete, the facilities are degraded, we need to modernize them to meet international standard and government is not sleeping on that. We have made a presentation on that before Mr. President and we are about to roll out our plans on modernizing and upgrading our facilities at the airports,"" she said.",<urn:uuid:e461577d-0cf5-4a03-9e99-046a4b103486>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://allafrica.com/stories/201012090781.html,2013-05-18T06:55:55Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.976132691,350,,,,,
"Brikama beat Barra, Essau and Mayamba 1-0 in their tricky quarterfinal clash to seal a place in the semi-final in the ongoing Super Nawettan zonal football tournament at the Brikama Mini Stadium on Wednesday.
Barra, Essau and Mayamba made a fascinating start to the game and launched some occasionally goal-scoring opportunities but all those assaults were denied by Brikama's formidable defence.
Brikama, on the other hand, created some goal-scoring opportunities but also failed to capitalize on their limited chances thus the first half ended goalless.
Upon resumption of the second half, Brikama brought in midfielder Modou Lamin Sawo, Modou Jallow (alias Figo), and Momodou Camara and contained Barra, Essau and Mayamba in the midfield, whilst also created numerous goal-scoring opportunities.
Their efforts yielded dividends in the 73rd minute of the game when substitute Modou Lamin Sawo netted the opener, which eventually proved to be the winner for the West Coast Region giants.
Edrissa Sonko-Faye could have levelled the score for Barra, Essau and Mayamba in the 82nd minute of the game when he dribbled past Brikama defenders and rounded goalkeeper Mamudou S. Bojang but his shot went away thus the game ended 1-0 in favour of Brikama.
Debutants Brufut have also progressed to the semifinal following their 3-2 post-match shootout win over Serrekunda East in the other quarterfinal game, after a goalless draw in the regulation time at the Serrekunda East Mini Stadium on the same day.
Brikama will now clash with Brufut in the semifinal set for today, 20 December 2012, at the Brikama Mini Stadium.

"(WASHINGTON)â€“ Congressman Allen West (R-FL) met with representatives from the Internal Revenue Service this week to discuss solutions to the growing number of taxpayer identity fraud cases in South Florida. Federal Trade Commission reports show tax-related identity fraud continues to plague the United States, most notably South Florida, where more than half of the 20,000 Florida identity fraud cases to the IRS have been detected.
â€œIt has become too easy and far too common for criminals to obtain the taxpayer identification numbers of people and file fraudulently in their name,â€ West said. â€œTodayâ€™s meeting with the IRS allowed me to hear directly from the agency as to what investigators are doing to prevent this crime. I challenge the IRS to determine a more efficient system for tracking who these criminals are and how they are obtaining taxpayer identification numbers.â€
IRS leaders discussed with Congressman West several new systems implemented this year to identify and track fraud, including a â€œdetection codeâ€ assigned to suspicious filings.
â€œI can assure you, we are getting better everyday,â€ Jodi Patterson, Director of Return Integrity with the IRS, told Congressman West. â€This is a top priority for the IRS.â€
Patterson also assured Congressman West the IRS is improving its system for how operators handle taxpayers who believe their identity has been stolen.
â€œWe have spent a great deal of time training our operators on how to interact and best help expedite the reporting process, â€ Patterson said.
West asked the IRS to report back to him at the end of April on improvements the IRS has made over last year, including a report of indicators and warnings the IRS has discovered through its investigation. West also encouraged the IRS to work with local law enforcement to better track down criminals on a local level.
â€œOur local law enforcement is well aware of this problem and they want to be involved,â€ West said. â€I am confident the IRS is listening to our concerns and will continue tracking down these criminals until this problem is solved.â€

"Category: Crime Created on Friday, 17 August 2012 11:25 Published Date Written by All Ghana News Hits: 204
Nyinahin (Ash), Aug 16, GNA â€“ A 33-year old car washer, who allegedly burst into a church during worship and severely beat up the officiating pastor has appeared before a Nyinahin Magistrate Court.
Patrick Ben Nyarko is charged with assault and pleaded guilty with explanation.
He was ordered to be kept in prison custody to re-appear on Wednesday, August 29th.
Police Inspector Daniel Otabil told the court presided over by Mr Sam Nibi that the complainant, Pastor Augustine Marfo, is the Minister in-charge of the Church of Christ at Nyinahin in the Atwima-Mponua District.
The accused also lives in the same community.
On Sunday August 12th at about mid-day, Pastor Marfo was delivering the sermon to the congregation, when Nyarko suddenly rushed in and without any provocation brutally assaulted him to the surprise of the worshippers.
His justification was that the pastor was misleading the church members through false Bible teachings.
Police Inspector Otabil said the accused was mad at the claim by the complainant that â€œwhat men can do, women can also doâ€ insisting that this could not be found anywhere in the Holy Bible.
He was overpowered by the congregation and handed over to the Police.
Nyarko in his caution statement said he was acting on the orders of the Holy Spirit to stop the pastor from preaching falsehood.

This is a Article on The Little Old Lady in General Articles About Nursing, part of General Nursing ... It had been a rough day, and I had to be out of work at 3:30 because I had clinical that evening. ...by Ms Kylee Aug 20, '08It had been a rough day, and I had to be out of work at 3:30 because I had clinical that evening.
I was doing the usual end of shift vitals when I walked past what had been an empty room all day. In the room chair sat a very petite lady looking very lost and scared.
I walked in, shook her hand, and introduced myself. She told me her name, and followed it by ""I had a doctor's appointment today and he sent me right here and wouldn't tell me why. I don't have anything either. He wouldn't let me go back home and pack a bag.""
I told her that we had stuff on the unit, and I'd pack her up a goodie bag and be right back. I returned a few minutes later with the usual patient goodie bag, blankets, gown, lift pad, towels, washcloths, and tissues.
Sensing she wanted to keep her independence, I handed her the gown and asked her if she needed any help getting undressed. She told me no, but asked me to stay with her anyway. After getting her vitals and getting her into bed, I found her nurse and told gave her a report. I followed it up with her being very scared. I stayed with her for another hour and missed clinical, but it was worth every hour I had to make up.
I had the pleasure of taking care of her for almost two weeks. During her stay, we had wonderful talks and she told me all about her life, her family, and she gave me a wonderful recipe for red gravy. One morning, I was told she needed to go downstairs for a test. I brought the stretcher in to her room and I could tell immediately she was scared. As she got on the stretcher she said to me ""Kylee, I'm scared I won't survive this test."" I tried to offer reassurance, but nothing came past the lump in my throat. Instead, I gave her a big hug. Before I could think of something to say in reassurance, transport came to take her downstairs.
Two days later, I returned from my day off, and didn't see her name on my patient list. As I was puzzling things out, the nursing assistant that I was relieving came to give me report.
When she gave me the first report, my stomach just dropped. My beloved patient had stroked and was life flighted over to our trauma hospital. I held things together till report was finished, then I made a visit to the bathroom and cried my eyes out. When I returned to the floor five minutes later, I got funny looks from the staff, but nobody asked me, and I didn't volunteer any information.
A week later, I read her obituary in the paper, and I cried as I read it.
All I could remember was how she had told me she was afraid to go for the procedure, and how she felt she had another few years of life left to give. I also remembered how she loved bread from an Italian restaraunt in town. I remembered that last hug, and those final words she said to me. ""Kylee, I love you. You're going to be a wonderful nurse someday.""
RIP Miss B. I love you too.Last edit by Ms Kylee on Aug 21, '08 : Reason: fixed typo

"Priority diagnosis question from a first time poster.Register Today!
This is a discussion on Priority diagnosis question from a first time poster. in Nursing Student Assistance, part of Nursing Student ... Hello All, I've been using AllNurses since I began in nursing school but this is my first post....by It's Just a Ride Nov 23, '12Hello All,
I've been using AllNurses since I began in nursing school but this is my first post. I had a patient in clinical this week and my priority diagnosis isn't completely clear to me.
This elderly patient was in the CCU after an AMI with CHF ~ 45 days prior, history of hypertension, diabetes, family Hx of heart disease. He has a trach/vent in place and appears to be unable to wean due to the potential for right side heart failure.
His heart is the problem. He's on the vent because his heart can't handle the increased workload, SO, I'm thinking Decreased Cardiac Output as my priority, but they've drilled ABC's into our brains so many times a little voice is telling me ""B comes before C,"" but it's the heart, not lungs, that are the real issue. Right?
Also, could I simlpy use AEB AMI, and ventilator dependency? Your insights are appreciated.
Print and share with friends and family.

- Nov 23, '12 by ImKosherWhat's your related factors? What is your A/E/B? Following your ABC, we need to figure out if the airway and lungs is contributing to his condition at all and if it priority. Tell us a little more about the pt.
- Nov 23, '12 by It's Just a RideAside from the Hx I mentioned (HTN, diabetes, fam Hx of heart disease), the pt had no indication of CHF until he was braught in for the AMI. He was described as a stable, critical patient. Stable on the vent, critical off of it.
I was thinking Decreased Cardiac Output or Inneffective Tissue Perfusion, but he is stable currently so those would be ""risk for"" at the moment, right? A therefor wouldn't be used as primary diagnoses. He's on bedrest, NPO, trach/vent, and was in between an NG and PEG tube placement when I was work with him. He is dependent, alert and oriented, and denied any pain although he had a nasty ulcer on the posterior left wrist from dopamine infiltration.
His airway has some mucus production so I could go that direction. He required suctioning twice while I was there. His breathing is controlled by the vent. His heart is stable provided his lungs have assistance from the vent.
These diagnoses usually make sense to me but after my first day on CCU I'm not sure what direction this should be going.
- Nov 23, '12 by fireballnursieInsufficient gas exchange related to decreases cardiac function as evidence by inability to ween off artificial life support.
- Nov 23, '12 by It's Just a RideI can see this connection. Thank you very much FireBall.
And thank you Kosher for the input.
- Dec 1, '12 by GrnTeaThat would be ""decreased,"" ""wean,"" and we don't say ""artificial life support"" for something like this.
Let's back up here.
How do you know he's on the vent because his right heart might not be able to manage without it? It may be that the work of breathing is just more than he can handle, and if he isn't ventilated mechanically he will not be able to move enough air to stay alive. He is old and has a bad heart, and that resulting weakness may be the reason he's on the vent. The vent doesn't decrease right heart workload per se.
However, decreased cardiac output itself would certainly cause him to be weak. Seems to me that he has at least two priority problems: he can't move enough air to support himself, and his heart is too weak to support any activity. Now, go to your NANDA-I 2012-2014, which every nursing student should have even if his/her faculty neglected to put it on the bookstore list (free 2-day shipping from Amazon), and see what nursing diagnoses fit these defining characteristics. That's how you determine nursing diagnoses-- you identify the defining characteristics by your own assessment, then see what diagnoses they point to. It's just like checking a hematocrit to help make the medical diagnosis of anemia.
I hope you haven't already turned this in, because in my opinion you're a little confused about cause and effect here. Hope we hear back from you.",<urn:uuid:2125b549-64b3-4c17-a9d0-5ce81c17ea0d>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://allnurses.com/nursing-student-assistance/priority-diagnosis-question-799002.html,2013-05-18T08:12:50Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.975109041,1042,,,,,
"This weekâ€™s guild spotlight is with the guild Dead Faction! We have the guild leader, Beastar, here to tell us more about the guild.Guild: Dead Faction
Can you give us a little history about Dead Faction?
Dead Faction is a guild created few month ago. Since I started to play in April 2010, its was one of my goals to create a guild.
So, I made it with some people that I knew well for a bit. At this moment, we decided our ultimate objective. The â€ultimate objective â€ of Dead Faction was (and still) to help new peoples and obtain an Astral ship. Now, we have around 130 members and we are always talking in the chat or partying in Lightwood tavern XD. Weâ€™re all happy of what we achieved and we hope to continue our mission.
What are the people of Dead Faction like?
Letâ€™s say, we have every kind of player: high level, PvP, occasional players, hardcore, clown (yeah, some of us are really funny), beginner, every class and every race! We are really opened to all class, races, and levels. That makes us unique. Nobody feel like being in a sea of people, everyone is important.
Thatâ€™s what we are!
What are the goals of Dead Faction?
As I said, our goal is to obtain an Astral ship (and maybe a fleet of Astral ships!) and help everyone. If someone is level 40 and need a party for a dungeon, weâ€™ll help him or her. If a level 10 wants to understand how the game works, weâ€™ll help him or her. Sometimes (in fact everyday), we like to travel to Holy Land and do what we call â€ Imperial Huntingâ€. Its some kind of PvP against imperial players. Every month, we organize guild events (like parties, Goblinball,) and weâ€™re really happy about it.
How would one go about joining Dead Faction?
None. Thereâ€™s no criteria. We accept everyone. Every class, race, level, etc. As long as youâ€™re online at least one time every month. Other then that, weâ€™re open to anyone who wants to join.
What do you see in Dead Factionâ€™s future in Allods Online?
I see the whole guild in the most spectacular fleet of Astral ships, having combat and many exploration in the Astral :), making gigantic war in Nezebgrad and Holy land. That how I saw our future, with a lot of enjoyment and happiness (and party ;p ).
If youâ€™re part of a guild and you would like to have your guild in the spotlight, please have your guild leader email us with information about your guild at email@example.com!

"SwiftKey Keyboard for Android Gets Smarter
The autocorrect function on smartphone keyboards can be helpful, but it can also lead to some hilarious and embarrassing mistakes. SwiftKey, a virtual keyboard for Android, looks to eliminate those errors by learning how you type and predicting what youâ€™ll write next, and itâ€™s getting smarter.
Today, TouchType, the developers of SwiftKey, released an updated version of the keyboard that brings more intelligent correction capabilities and an improved user interface.
New to SwiftKey 3 is a feature called â€œSmart Space.â€ This detects when youâ€™ve inserted a space in the middle of a word or forgotten to insert spaces while quickly typing a string of words and automatically corrects it for you.
The keyboard also now has a larger space bar and a smart punctuation key that gives you quick access to common punctuation. You can also change up the look of the keyboard with two new themes, one called â€œCobaltâ€ and another called â€œHolo,â€ which looks similar to the keyboard in Androidâ€™s latest operating system, Ice Cream Sandwich.
Finally, SwiftKey 3 adds support for seven additional languages, including Korean, Serbian and Farsi, bringing the total number of supported languages to 42.
SwiftKey is different from other virtual keyboards like Swype because it tries to customize itself to the user. You can sync it with your Gmail, Facebook and Twitter accounts, so it can learn your typing habits and vocabulary. By doing so, SwiftKey can not only complete words for you, but it can also predict the next word based on context.
SwiftKey 3 is available now from the Google Play store and is currently on sale for $1.99. The promotion ends in one week, when the app will go back to its regular price of $3.99.",<urn:uuid:9bf46830-e481-499c-8702-b92d471ebd37>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://allthingsd.com/20120621/swiftkey-keyboard-for-android-gets-smarter/?refcat=reviews,2013-05-18T06:51:24Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.910316527,385,,,,,

I was born in London and and spent my younger years there before moving into the country where the few years left of my childhood came to an end, my adult life started, and where I now live with the most special man in my life, my teenage son. As a result, both the hustle and bustle of city life and the calm serenity of country life appeal to me and have equally influenced much of my work. I have been drawing since I was able to hold a crayon and have mainly worked on very small intricate pictures but have discovered the joy of painting on canvas over the last couple of years along with the excitement of creating large pieces of artwork. The smallest painting I have done was 30 x 40 cm, but as well as several others, I am currently working on a piece of art which is around ten feet long which will be eventually be included on here as well. I often work from photographs which are given to me and paint a large, stylized version to hang on the wall. Of course, many pieces I have done have been personal to the requester and since these tend to be friends, little money changes hands. But now I am working on some that I have chosen myself and that I hope to sell to help my son through university.There are not many to display yet, but I hope you like what you see. More will be appearing over time so watch this space...Thank you for taking the time to look, I welcome your comments.",<urn:uuid:9f084965-85cb-4eee-9d5f-2c95584ec9b4>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://alltradeart.net/fuzzipeg77/decks,2013-05-18T08:12:14Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.974533558,348,,,,,
"My number one obsession is my hair. Iâ€™m constantly obsessing over it because itâ€™s the best accessory any women can have. Short, long, curly or straight your hair compliments you and shows off your unique style. You could be wearing the best outfit and the killer heels but if your hair isnâ€™t cooperating and you're having a bad hair day, then honey Iâ€™m sorry but your outfit is not complete. I could be in sweats and sneakers but as long as my hair looks good thatâ€™s all I care about. The trick to great hair is to find out what works for you. What works for someone with curls may not work with someone who has straight hair. You may have to experiment with different brands be it high end or drugstore to see whatâ€™s the perfect combination for you. My mother is a hairdresser so I definitely get my obsession from her! I have curls but I use different hair products when itâ€™s curly and different products when itâ€™s straight.
You also have to be conscious of your hair cut. For example, a blunt hair cut is a huge donâ€™t for someone like me with curly hair. That would send my hair into frizz hell! Unless you are planning to keep your hair straight all the time (something Iâ€™ve done for the right haircut) then something like that wouldnâ€™t be for you. My tips for great hair are
- Find yourself a great hairdresser who understands your hair.
- Experiment with products that work for you.
- A great haircut makes all the difference!
What hair products do you live by? I would love to hear any tips you may have to add to how you keep your hair gorgeous!",<urn:uuid:0f9646ee-4907-48ef-828b-a199e135bebc>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://allwomenstalk.com/the-best-accessory,2013-05-18T05:58:07Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.9542979,364,,,,,
"Savanna is one of our top black females, she has extremely dense jet black fibre with good character and consistancy. She produced a true black male off Sunnyhills Bandit that did well at the Canadian National Futurity.He has since been sold to Ontrio. She has some great genetics in her background including Lady Shilo, a blue Black Reserve champion. Which is now deceased. Shilo was the best black female I have seen to date and had a 13.7 CV. Savanna was bred to Birchleaf Nomad, our Can. Nat. Grey Black Grand Champion Male form the Hemingway & Bueno lines. - Savanna has done it again, this time producing a spectacular dark Fawn girl, from Nomad.
Nomad was late to develope, partly because of a broken bone in his jaw, that we discovered as a yearling, but is making up for it now. He settled 3 females last spring and we are excited to see the results. He has incredible fleece for a grey, with vertually no guard hair.With Grandpa on his sires side being Hemingway and Bueno on his dams,also Lady Shilo (black Champion) as his Grandmother,you can see why he's turned out so spectacular.His 08 cria's have arrived and all three are females.
Accepting Breedings for 08, (only 3 Available) to Select Females.

Jayda has it all, presence, elite fibre, great personality, exact bite, beautiful head, and the right conformation. Our favorite female of the 09 season. After weaning, her fleece went from dark brown to a bay black as you can see in the fibre photo and is now changing back to dark brown. Wish she would settle on a colour. Lineage goes back to Hemingway on her Sires side and Turk/ Ivano on her Dams.

"""I think it would be valuable if we had... uh... I mean, there's some sense where blogs correct themselves if you read enough of them, but I still I think it would be good if we had some sort of, you know, blogging -- you know -- council, where we could condemn people. Sort of... responsible body. You could still blog if you want. Nobody's going to stop you. But we're going to... everybody's gonna know that you're not to be trusted... unless you can sort of apologize or answer for yourself.""I thought it was revealing, and I used the quote (cut down a bit) in my NYT column yesterday. (Free here.)
On the blog, I said I was ""put off by the mindset he revealed"" -- that desire to ""blacklist"" -- and in the NYT, I called it the ""impulse to control.""
Alterman is right to read my quoting and characterization as a very harsh accusation. I wouldn't call it ""the typical liberal tendency toward fascism,"" as he does. If I was going to use the inflammatory word ""fascism,"" I wouldn't say ""the typical liberal tendency toward fascism,"" which makes no sense to me. At the very least, I'd replace ""liberal"" with ""left-wing"" or ""illiberal.""
The idea of fascism does come up in the comments. In the second comment, Jeff says: ""The leftist will to power (and more importantly, control) rears its ugly head."" A little further down, Mike just says: ""Fascism - Oppressive or dictatorial control."" And John takes a hard (but humorous) swipe:
Alterman is one of those pathetic little mediocrities who in another time and place would be a very dangerous person. Put him Weimar Germany, revolutionary France or early Soviet Russia and he would be full fledged rhetorical thug pushing the brown shirted masses to smash windows and heads. As it is, he is just fascist little prick whom you hope will disappear like a rash if properly ignored. I almost hope he would start such a council just so I can start blogging and get on the blacklist.Later, Mike comes back with:
I don't think Eric Alterman is a fascist (though he is many other disagreeable things) but I find it amusing that it is his ilk who are prone to hurl that term, yet it is they who are the control freaks.So Alterman is right to feel provoked and, really, embarrassed to have shown so much of an urge to repress and control. His own words were telling. It's not my habit to type out spoken word, and I don't monitor Bloggingheads episodes for stray quotes to use to make people look bad. That quote jumped out at me and demanded transcription. And I think Eric knows he was saying something bad. The pattern of the stammer, with the double ""you know,"" is telling.
Let's work our way through Eric's reverie.
1) It was a conversation. I was just sort of musing.Right! That's why it's so interesting. The things people say when they let their guard down...
But still, it's fair game.Damn right.
2) I do actually believe what I said. Ever since the beginning of blogging-time, I have worried -- in public and on blogging panels -- about the loss of the media's gatekeeper function. Now, I believe I literally wrote the book on this topic -- and it's about to go out of print for the second time, so if you don't own it, hassle Cornell University Press -- and I am as aware as anyone on earth, I believe, of the dangers of the misuse of that function. Almost all of my books deal with this tension in one way or another. But the fact is, the function is absolutely necessary. A democracy of hundreds of millions of people is functionally impossible for reasons it requires an entire book to explain. Particularly when the media profess to strive toward objectivity, punditry/gatekeepers play a crucial role. My problem with the punditocracy has never been that they are pundits, but that they are so incompetent at the job they do.There you have it. Controlling speech seems to be his mission in life. What's he really saying here? He writes books, and he's obsessed with speech, but he's none too articulate.
The ""function"" of ""gatekeeping"" is ""absolutely necessary."" And, speaking of functions, something is ""functionally impossible."" On a quick read, I thought he was saying that gatekeeping -- that function -- is functionally impossible. But no, what is functionally impossible is democracy. But you'll have to read his book to understand why. Here we see even more of the urge to control.
You can't have your democracy, and there are a lot of complex reasons why you can't, as elite, intellectual study shows. I own the truth. I write the books. If you can get your hands on the hard-to-find book and spend some good long time with it, you might come to understand what I already know. I am the gatekeeper of this information explaining why you can't have democracy. Trust me.
Notice that phrase ""media's gatekeeper function."" The media deliver information, but Alterman characterizes that as gatekeeping. The emphasis is on what they don't let out. Not having read his book, I'm not sure what he's driving at in point #1. I get the sense it's that voters are dependent on the media filtering the information well, and bloggers ought to improve that filtering, not bypass it. You don't want too much information, because it might be bad.
3) If bloggers are going to perform this function -- that is, helping busy and usually uninformed people make sense of the world -- we are going to have to employ some sort of standard with which to judge their reliability. If they are pathological liars, psychopaths, religious or ideological extremists who cannot be trusted to tell the truth, well then, it'd be useful to have them branded as such -- in order to keep them from further infecting the body politic with even more lies, ideological obsessions, and intellectual corruptions. True, the mainstream media do not do a great job of this themselves anymore, but many people inside it do try. In many cases, their brands and relationship to their peers depend on it.Speech as disease! Some speakers are sick, and they may cause infection! He would justify quarantines. This man does not believe in free speech. He will not put his faith in the marketplace of ideas and the remedy of more speech.
4) Bloggers tend to argue that this problem will sort itself out over time.That's scarcely some eccentric blogger thought. It's the core idea of American free speech.
I worry about the ""over time"" part. I also worry about all the damage that can be done in the interim.This is the mindset of a censor. Of course, you mean well. You're here to save us from ourselves.
And so I raised it on Bloggingheads.tv and offered up a notion in response. Maybe it's a bad idea. It's not as if I gave it any thought before I said it.Well, you did write those books. This is your area of expertise, isn't it? It's just that you let the words tumble out this time, and it showed more ugliness that you would have liked. If only you could control things more, control freak.
But I'm not convinced it is [a bad idea]. Or at least, I've yet to see a better one. After all, it's a panel of bloggers; it's the judgment of one's peers and it would enjoy no power whatever, save the influence it amasses by virtue of the quality of its judgments. Just what is so threatening about that?I'm not threatened by your panel. I simply loathe your censorious frame of mind, your fear of speech as sickness, your urge to control and purify, and your belief in the beneficence of panels. I thank God that I live in a country where the institution you dream of would not be allowed to ""enjoy power.""
So now, instead of quivering in fear about what my supposed ""peers"" would like to do to me, I'll have another cup of coffee and a nice little giggle over the way you finally expressed some faith in the marketplace of ideas -- when it came time to talk about why your damned panel should be trusted.

The couple seemed happy about it, so yes. Really it is a subjective thing and the bride and groom get the only votes.
I don't see how it can be bad etiquette if the bride and groom were happy to see her there.Did she send a gift?
That's a lovely picture at the link.
If I understood the article correctly the bride and groom left their event to see her, not the other way around. And they were evidently thrilled to see her. She neither tried to, nor did, upstage the bride.Are you practicing writing headlines for the MSM, Ann?
""a U.S. Marine and his new bride enjoying their wedding reception in the Pappas Room asked to get some pictures. The newlyweds now had another reason to grin from ear to ear as they were overheard saying â€œweâ€™ll never forget that Sarah Palin came to our weddingâ€. She was invited. Post fail.
Per the article, Palin was in one area and the wedding party was in another. I'm sure you've all been in restaurants with similar semi-separate function halls. The couple sought her out, not the other way around. No foul. No bad etiquette.
""The couple seemed happy about it, so yes.""Did they have much choice? How could the bride have expressed unhappiness in this situation?
I did not misread the article. The things you're pointing out were completely taken into account. I am challenging you to think more deeply.
Are all brides beautiful? That's a pretty girl.
â€œweâ€™ll never forget that Sarah Palin came to our weddingâ€. Is that the memory the woman was hoping to lock into her permanent memory? In the phrase ""It's her day,"" the ""her"" isn't supposed to be a politician that shows up for a photo op.
It makes the reception that much more memorable (in a good way) for the guests, which flatters the bride.
""Did they have much choice? How could the bride have expressed unhappiness in this situation?""Again, it appears they left their party in a back room and came out to see Palin. And Palin has never struck me as the type of person who would barge in on a wedding party. Hillary sure. Barry definitely. Palin, I don't see it. Maybe she did, but that's not what the article says.So, yes, I'd say they had a choice.Seriously, the guy is a US Marine. I doubt you could find many who wouldn't be thrilled to see her. And that includes the wife of one.
""Ann Althouse said...Did they have much choice? How could the bride have expressed unhappiness in this situation?""Let me go out on a limb...they could have not asked her?
I don't see how it would mar ""her day"", but I do see how it would make it far more memorable for their guests, and I think all couples want that. I assume the woman was just as pleased as she sounds, and that she wouldn't have left her wedding reception to hit the chicken wing counter for just anyone.
Limbaugh did that.He crashed some wedding reception that happened to be going on in the hotel where he was.Invited by a band member he ran into.It also turned out to be a military groom; and likewise got a favorable reaction from them.
""I am challenging you to think more deeply.""If thinking deeply means reading things into the article that are not there, I guess I could come up with a dozen possible senarios.So, yeah, if Palin had without invitation entered the back room where a private bridal party was being held for a photo op that would have been a violation of etiquette. It also would have been politically stupid.But I don't see Palin as either rude enough to do it nor, at this stage in her political career, stupid enough to do it.
""Ann Althouse said...I am challenging you to think more deeply.""Everything in the artice points to a joint decision to ask Palin for pictures, as well as a mutual satisfaction that she did so.I am challenging you to think. Period.
Ann Althouse said... I am challenging you to think more deeplyIn other words, read between the lines, because it might not be there when you read the article.
Really, Professor? Have you ever been to the Puritan? Do you know anything about it? How it's laid out? She went into the main part. The Marine and his bride were in a private room quite a ways away. They came to greet her and ask her for pictures. Had she not taken the time to visit with them when they asked, what would the headlines read? Jesus fucking Christ on a fucking pogo stick. ""I'm challenging you to think more deeply.No, you're not. You're just being blonde and it's not attractive, not matter what Meade tells you.
I am challenging you to think more deeply.The appearance of this sentence is always an infallible sign that Althouse has been caught in an error.
PALIN CRASHES WEDDING!UPSTAGES BRIDE!OPENS HER GIFTS!SLEEPS WITH HER HUSBAND....developing....
""It makes the reception that much more memorable (in a good way) for the guests, which flatters the bride.""Well, that's kind of my theory of weddings, which is why I didn't want one. If it's all about making the guests have a great time and not a boring time like all those other weddings... save your effort and money...I think people who put on weddings are thinking about making the bride a fabulous center of attention. If another woman upstages her... it's not what that was about.
BTW:Ann Althouse said... â€œweâ€™ll never forget that Sarah Palin came to our weddingâ€. Is that the memory the woman was hoping to lock into her permanent memory? In the phrase ""It's her day,"" the ""her"" isn't supposed to be a politician that shows up for a photo op.*************It was, by the way and don't forget, the reception. They left their reception and asked Palin for pictures. Palin didn't crash the damn wedding demanding the focus be on her. Palin went to a fairly famous local eatery to get some of the fairly famous chicken fingers and chat with some locals. That's hardly showing up for a goddam photo op. Then, while she was waiting for her food, she was accosted by a young Marine and his wife all agog and agibber that Sarah Fucking Palin was there.Jesus.
""She went into the main part. The Marine and his bride were in a private room quite a ways away. They came to greet her and ask her for pictures.""I'm picturing the guests getting wind of Sarah's presence and scampering away from the wedding to get a look. That's stage 1. The bride is upset by that and the people around her try to make the lemons into lemonade or whatever.
""Palin went to a fairly famous local eatery to get some of the fairly famous chicken fingers and chat with some locals. That's hardly showing up for a goddam photo op.""It's obviously a political photo op. Give me a break. I'm not saying Palin intended to crash the wedding, but that's the way it played out.
rhhardin said... Limbaugh did that.Did what? Stand downstairs at the take out counter and be accosted by a Marine and a woman in a wedding dress? Not the same thing. Don't write it like it is.
(The Uncredentialed, Crypto Jew) Let me just add for the progressives, â€œQuitterâ€, â€œDitzâ€, â€œUnelectableâ€ â€œSmurf-house Al-tardsâ€ Capishay? Oh and I liked the phrase ""Think more deeply"" and the retort...""I made an error"".
""I'm picturing the guests getting wind of Sarah's presence and scampering away from the wedding to get a look. That's stage 1. The bride is upset by that and the people around her try to make the lemons into lemonade or whatever.""I give up. She was probably pissed. So pissed I imagine it's a wonder she didn't ask her Marine husband to snap Palin's neck like a chicken finger.
If you cared to read the article, the bride and groom sought out Palin, to be photographed with her.She really sticks in your craw, eh?
What proof do you have that it was obviously a photo op? A couple of days ago Palin wore dark glasses and an extra shirt and a hat pulled low to run a half marathon. It's not like she's some sort of messianic figure traveling across the country in a giant black armored bus with a 40 vehicle motorcade!Yes, she went there to get chicken and talk to people. But I don't believe she sent her advance people in to drag the Marine and his bride out to see her. I ask you again: have you ever been to the Puritan? The Marine and his bride had to actually leave their private room. It's not like they were just at a table in the back. Ask me how I know....
The only thing that could have upstaged that was to continue with honeymoon three-way.
WILL SOMEONE TAKE THE SHOVEL OUT OF THE PROFESSOR'S HANDS BEFORE SHE STRIKES WATER AND FLOODS THE HOLE SHE'S DIGGING!
I don't see how famous people can avoid all possible places where a wedding reception might be occurring. So you can't blame Palin for being near a wedding reception, or for the reaction of people at the venue.
(The Uncredentialed, Crypto Jew) I will say that IF Palin gets in and gets the nod, Althouse will NOT be voting for her? Someone said it best, â€œShe sticks your craw.â€ Palin just sticks in Althouseâ€™s craw and so the Althouse demographic is a write-off for Palin in 2012, thatâ€™s for sureâ€¦.Letâ€™s try one more tack here, Althouse, IF the bride were upset, donâ€™t you think she could have found a sympathetic blogger/journalist upon which she could unload her â€œire?â€ After all itâ€™s not like people who hate Palin arenâ€™t a dime-a-dozen.
AnnI think you've got this one wrong.
She showed up at an open restaurant for dinner, she wasn't at their wedding. They seemed to have come out to see her and been happy she was there. So I would say no. Not at all.
You got upstaged from that article?Seriously???
Palin is upstaging everyone lately.The Bride had made plans for her reception. And the plans had to be adjusted on the spot.She was able to do the adult thing without pouting about changes made to her plan. Many people do that well.If she is married to a Marine, she had better get used to doing that.
Agreed...and I'm sure she loved every minute of it.
BREAKING !!!!Palin takes deep breath.Sucks air out of room.Women and children suffer most. Details at eleven.
""She was able to do the adult thing without pouting about changes made to her plan. Many people do that well.""I lay a bet of a bottle of nice whiskey she had no urge to pout at all.
Is that the memory the woman was hoping to lock into her permanent memory?There are a lot worse memories that happen at wedding receptions to lock into your memory. (Your bridesmaid or best man passing out or falling down drunk for one. Embarrassing fighting between the in-laws.)Perhaps they didn't vote for Obambi (unlike some people who refuse to admit that they made a terrible mistake) and they were THRILLED to see someone who represents their viewpoint and presents real hope for freedom and a change in our oppressive government. Or they were just happy to see a celebrity that they admire in their general vicinity.If Obama came to MY wedding, or any other event in my life, THAT would certainly be a horrific memory.It isn't like Palin said. ""Hey, here is a wedding. Let's crash it!!!"". It was more like. ""I'm getting something to eat and there happened to be a wedding nearby and they wanted me to take a photo with them. You betcha.""
""As word of her appearance spread throughout the restaurant, a U.S. Marine and his new bride enjoying their wedding reception in the Pappas Room asked to get some pictures.""I don't think she planned to crash the party. And, yes, if someone told her there was a reception going on, she could have left, but it doesn't sound as if that happened.Ann Althouse said...""The couple seemed happy about it, so yes.""Did they have much choice? How could the bride have expressed unhappiness in this situation?I'll bet the assembled press would have loved to hear the bride complain about the former Governor ruining her party.
If another woman upstages her... it's not what that was about.AHA!!! The crux of the matter. Fear of being upstaged by another woman.Get over yourself.
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, and presume that you were misled into ""thinking deeply"" by the term ""Back Room."" Like CEO-MMP, I've actually been in that restaurant. It started out as an ice-cream & burgers place. After a while they added an enclosed seating area at the back of the place. This area, called the ""Back Room,"" is actually the place where the general public goes to sit down and eat. It is not a fancy place.It's clear from the article that there were lots of other people in the Back Room at the time, none of whom was there for the wedding. The Pappas Room is completely separate.Also, it's located on a major highway and has a large parking lot, so it provides easy in-and-out for someone who gets a craving for a snack in the middle of a busy day.School must have started up again. Your're ""thinking deeply"" like a silly academic instead of a hardheaded blogger.
Famous people should just stay home. If we want to see them we can turn on the TV. Fame has lost them the right to come and go as they please.Or public places could have a neon sign in front, maybe a star inside a circle with a diagonal line across it. If anyone in the building is having a birthday, anniversary, wedding party, or any personal celebration, the sign would light up. This will let all the famous people know not to go in and upstage someone else's life.Maybe we could put all the famous people in cages like at the zoo. They need to learn their place.
The article could not be clearer: Palin went to a restaurant, had no reason to know there was a wedding going on in a private room, and responded graciously and appropriately when the bride and groom sought her out.Are your lame defenses of your original post in these comments are not up to your usual high standards. Please do the right thing and admit your dislike of Palin got the better of your judgment.
""Here's how Palin lost me, she crashed a wedding party once, and ruined two very nice people's lives for no reason at all, except to be mean."" -- AA
Didn't Palin also ruin a half-marathon for a bunch of people the other day by getting in front of them?Think about it. She's got all Alaska to run around in, plus Arizona. And yet she bigfooted some innocent Iowans. I'll bet they were pissed.What a bitch.
They look pretty happy about it and said as much...SarahPac
Palin is the good fairy to Cinderella. Plays into wedding mythology. As she continually draws political strength from matrimonial bonds (ie ""never thought I'd want a divorce"" in Iowa). The wedding bit came alongside widespread video of her hugging a very effeminate man. Reconciliation.
A lot of brides might fit the description you give of an immature, spoiled brat who wants all the attention on herself, no matter what. They're known around here as ""Bridezillas,"" and while I do think young girls are encouraged to think this way by the wedding industry, I don't think most fall into that trap, once they become women. Not the ones with any hope of having a lasting marriage, anyway.It also sounds to me like you might have a particular aversion to Bridezillas (hence your own low-key, deeply personal and private marriage). But you seem to assume Bridezillas are the norm rather the exception, and thus you are here both rejecting them, and accusing Sarah Palin (a political ""Bridezilla"" herself, perhaps?) of having the temerity to run afoul of one at the same time. Knocking down two distasteful female types at the same time: A two-fer! SCORE!I think I can see the connection; but I'm not buying it, based on the article, and the obvious delight of the bride. I think drawing the conclusion you do seems more snarky than insightful.
The best moment this bride had! Everyone who was there will remember this moment. Even better in that it seems so spontaneous.Don't see the down side. Think it's a treat. Let alone the picture! What bride wouldn't make that picture her very own best moment, too? (Not so much if it was obama showing up, though. Not with that crowd.)
""I did not misread the article. The things you're pointing out were completely taken into account. I am challenging you to think more deeply.""Oh for fuck's sake Ann quit trying to OVERTHINK everything. The answer is staring you right in the face. If you didn't reside in academia you would be forced to jettison so much of what you imagine is ""deep thinking"" and cut to the chase. That is the same deep thinking that allows you to imagine Obama is normal but proves to a person with normally functioning cognitive facilities that you are a classic example of the over-educated fool.
Also, since pictures of the couple with Sarah Palin were probably photographed by SarahPac's wonderful official photographer, Shealah Craighead, I bet they get a nice autographed photo with a signed inscription by the Governor.Shealah Craighead
In the pix at that link, the Palins look better-dressed than most of the other guests at that wedding.What? That wasn't the wedding party? That was a bunch of men in shorts and the like chowing down at a casual-dining joint? You mean to say that the bride and groom just barged in there like they owned the place and demanded a photo op?I'd better think more deeply about this whole thing.
Ann writes headlines to get us involved!She's like the referee in a soccer match who can use her hands to throw in the ball.Then we're left to look and lurk. Or to use words. And, not because we agree. But because we're human. And, opinions vary.
In the phrase ""It's her day,"" the ""her"" isn't supposed to be a politician that shows up for a photo op. When the happy couple invite family and friends to come celebrate with them, the family and friends are guests at the wedding. The bride and groom, in entertaining their guests, are to make it a great day for the guests. It is nice for guests to make it a great day for the bridal couple, but the onus is on the bride and groom to make it a great day for their guests. We need to get rid of the ""It's my/our day"" mentality. It makes for some really nasty wedding stories.I was happy when my neighbor--whom I did not expect to come--attending my wedding. His being there made my day, and still lights up my memories of that day.
Palin enters restaurant...upstages waitressSingle mother...no healthcare...tips may have sufferedOrder Soup of the Day, Daily special Patty Melt upstaged, sales suffer..Think deeply what a horrible, horrible women she is....
Waiting now for the ""You people just don't get my humor"" part of the thread.Should be arriving in about 15 more comments.
Oh, shame, Ann. It's not like she crashed the wedding. The Marine and his wife approached her, from what I read, and she 'put down her waffle,' so to speak, and obliged them. There's some as would have whined about it You angling for a media job?
Don't see any upstaging.
He is a Marine, so of course they are thrilled. Palin respects our military and loves America, and I am sure this couple would prefer her to be his CIC than Obama who holds nothing but contempt for our armed services.
The bait seems to have been taken.
I am challenging you to think more deeply.I think all of us did think ""more deeply"" about it. The consensus is that you're the one who's off base.Sorry about that.
OK, I've thought more deeply about this. Althouse is right. Here's how this plays out:1. Palin enters restaurant for snack.2. Excitement spreads among crowd in state where it is well known she has no chance of winning primary. Obvious plants.3. Bride and groom leave their wedding reception to see what the hubbub's about. See Palin. Decide to cut their losses and score an autographed photo with her. These are quite rare, and likely to appreciate rapidly in value after she's trounced in the primaries.4. Ann Althouse, the famous blogger, is the only person in America to figure out what really happened. Everyone else is duped by the fake smiles of the newlyweds.5. Althouse's insight is picked up by not-so-famous bloggers Yglesias, Klein, etc.; spreads to MSM.6. Swarm of reporters descends upon newlyweds during their honeymoon in order to get the truth about this story.7. Media swarm ruins couple's honeymoon.See? Althouse is correct once again.
Did they have much choice? How could the bride have expressed unhappiness in this situation?9/6/11 9:04 AM Ann Althouse said...I did not misread the article. The things you're pointing out were completely taken into account. I am challenging you to think more deeply.9/6/11 9:05 AMYeah Ann. You are thinking deeply...as in bottom dragging. How could the bride express displeasure? How about by opening her mouth and saying so? Did Sarah show up wearing a white gown or something? Yes you can be gracious and still express your feelings on your wedding day. My guess is Sarah Palin showing up at this wedding was like Johnny Fontaine showing up at the wedding in the Godfather. A coup for the bride, not an over shaddowing. Are you suggesting that if they were displeased, they would not have hesitated to say: ""Sarah Palin crashed our wedding!"" They sought her out and were thrilled by it (because they like Sarah Palin). Obviously if they did not like her, then things would have been different.
The bride looks thrilled! She could be faking it, but I doubt it--the kind of woman who would marry a Marine is the kind of woman who likes Sarah Palin.The groom looks a little nervous in the picture. Maybe he is wondering if he just met his next Commander in Chief .
To add insult to injury earlier that day Palin ran a half marathon in Iowa anonymously, finishing with a time of 1:46, second in her age group. She also ran faster than all the women in the age group below except one. She placed fifth overall among women of any age.
All this shows Ann is Sarah Palin can never win. She is always wrong. But ask yourself, if Barack and Michelle Obama showed up at that restaurant and the bride and groom did the same thing for them...would you have written the same post? My guess is you whould not have, but I am challenging you to think deeply.
Kurt Russell showed up when I was staying at Skydome once. Never thought I'd be upstaged by Snake Plissken but there it is.
Kurt Russell was the best man at my wedding. Actually he was not, but my best man did look sort of like Kurt Russell. Then he bedded two of the bridesmaids. And they knew about each other but both wanted him. He was coming off a divorce and feeling depressed so it perked him up. So he had a good time.
(The Uncredentialed, Crypto Jew)Then he bedded two of the bridesmaidsSimultaneously? IS thereâ€¦video?Oh let me use the Garage, line, â€œVideo, or it didnâ€™t happenâ€
Good gravy, you're serious about this, Althouse? Really?Palin probably just shouldn't leave her house anymore.
Many brides do not have that good a time at the wedding. Too much stress to talk to everyone and few get ton enjoy the food. I always advise young ladies to elope and their moms get upset.
Also, are all brides completely self-obsessed narcissists, or is someone projecting a little here?I should think that a military bride, in particular, might be a bit more down-to-earth than your average Bridezilla.
I think that Althouse is missing the big picture here.The real victim is Sheila Beermann, who drove all the way from Elk Point, SD to hopefully place first or second in the half marathon. Due to the unexpected entry of ""Sarah Heath"", poor sheila is relegated to a shameful third place in her age division.
Typical Palin aggressive photo opp. ..Marines, new bride hottie, swank hotel. She should just stripped n pulled a 3way wit' the grunt and his new ho.
Also, I think the professor needs a new tag: ""Paving the way to vote for Obama again.""
(The Uncredentialed, Crypto Jew) The Small Pathetic Voice chimes in to demonstrate why it is called the small pathetic voiceâ€¦must be sad to have to come to a POPULAR blog to scream, â€œLook at meâ€.
Ah it's JoeJoe, the Small Pathetic Kissingerite. Dissent bothers you doesn't it little man. For that matter, you're too crass and irrational to understand satire. Palin's another flagwaver. Why, stand in front of harleys, with flags and marines/vets, a few hotties--and.... she's Prez material! Not. Then, that's a bit too profound for a little shyster like you to understand isn't it JoeJoe.
Okay, I'm going to challenge the professor to think a little more deeply, too.How is a momentary photo-op able to upstage an entire wedding? How is it not still the bride's day? It's not like Palin got on the wedding table and did the watusi. She'll be in maybe one photo in the inevitable photo album, and it will be an interesting anecdote for the grandkids, nothing else.See, this is the kind of crazy Palin criticism that drives some of us up the wall.
(The Uncredentialed, Crypto Jew) The Small Pathetic Voice might want to check out and see if anyone truly cares about its opinionâ€¦I believe its blog has NO comments (unless you count the ONE I randomly placed there), which would seem to imply that no one really cares what it thinks or saysâ€¦I believe that is what drives the small voice to Althouseâ€™s Big Front Porch so it can scream, â€œLOOK AT MEâ€
As a pastor who officiates many weddings I have to constantly work at not letting my charm and charisma take the spotlight off the bride on her special day. I know how Sarah must feel.
.""... I am challenging you to think more deeply...""Methinks you're thinking too much into this.
@Kensington, you're dead right. IMAO it isn't men who erected the glass ceiling. It was women stabbing other women in the back.
Althouse, dear, Go to the bathroom and purge. Quick! Quick! Quick! Get that kool-aid out of your system. I'm thinking deeply about this. I'm thinking ahead.

Caribou Barbie has been sent back to the Rancho de Klondike, at least virtually. The GOP pork-in-chief have given her the boot.
I should think that a military bride, in particular, might be a bit more down-to-earth than your average Bridezilla. If I am understanding correctly from the locals and the pictures, they seem to have had their reception at some kind of chicken shack. So I donâ€™t have her pegged as any kind of Bridezilla.
Shanna said ""...So I donâ€™t have her pegged as any kind of Bridezilla.""Exactly. This is kind of a weird post for this site, I think -- jr hi style sneering by the ""cool"" girl, nose held high -- and the target seems to be both traditional brides and Sarah Palin. Unless Althouse was just snickering to herself all the while she posted it, as Chip S. suggests. In which case, the target was us.This does not comfort me!
Even if the bride were a self-absorbed twit she would have the satisfaction of knowing that it is unlikely that a famous person will show up at her friends' wedding receptions. (It's not about having the perfect wedding/reception, it's about having one that is better than your friends'.)When a friend or family member gets married, you know whose reception will get mentioned every time. It's almost as good as having your wedding dance video go viral.
Where's the picture? No link at the story.Truth be known, most receptions are nice but totally forgettable.
One of the most inane, catty, and asinine posts ever.
And Professor -- you really have lost touch (I hope temporarily) with the real people.There are lots of real people out here who don't fake stuff and / or lie about everything.(PS - it was a wedding reception, not the ""wedding."")
take the spotlight off the bride on her special daySo special when they've been shacking up for years and her virtue was gone long before that.And shouldn't it be ""their day"", or are women so insecure they think ensnaring a man makes them special?
""Think more deeply"" = come up with a plausible scenario where it would be true that the bride was upstaged.So:The news spreads throughout the restaurant that Palin is there. The marine groom hears and is all ""Oh boy, let's go meet her and get a picture!!"" The bride is feeling pretty miffed that her new husband is even able to THINK about another woman during their wedding reception. Recognizing that it would be counterproductive to make a scene just then, she deploys the same social expertise which got her to the altar in the first place and ""enthusiastically"" agrees. The poor groom won't find out how badly he screwed up until he is reminded on their first anniversary, and second, and third ....
Shanna: they seem to have had their reception at some kind of chicken shackThanks to Google and Google Maps, you can see what this place looks like for yourself. And while I am a fan of church basement receptions, I'd say that this place looks like a proper place for a wedding reception. (And you can have the wedding there, too.) Hardly a ""chicken shack"" by any stretch of the imagination.
Fact is, Althouse lost all credibility when it comes to Palin.Don't bother to post anything more about her-If you need to know what Althouse's take on anything Palin is in the future, tune into Rachael Maddow.This is quite troublesome-
RAF..apparently 'think more deeply' means 'recaitulate stock plot from failed ABC sitcom...'
Thanks for the link Peter, it looks like the kind of place we would like and Manchester NH is only about 20 minutes North of here.
Ann, come on, all your 'picturings' would be thrown out of any court as assuming facts not in evidence, let alone a John Edwards level of channeling. We get you don't like Palin but we can watch Bill Maherfor this...

Someday the history of how and why the Republican Party, once the party of sane fiscal policy and non intervention, decided to tack to the far right and become the party of the wacko, will be written and I am sure a whole chapter will be devoted to the fascination so many have for this no talent, intellectually challenged, loud mouthed whack job. I know she drives the Left nuts, because even they are amazed that anyone, even on the Right, would take her seriously but really? This idiot? LOL Good luck running her for anything folks.
Friend of mine was at a wedding when Meir Kahane showed up, with bodyguards. Says he went to a lot of effort to remain unnoticed.

Obviously @Althouse has bought into the Bridezilla reality tv show version of the wedding and the brides out of control narcissim that reflects today's society.Personally, I'm hoping we're raising young women that have a better sense of themselves and what makes their marriage commitment significant beyond a surprise celebrity/politician showing up, the most expensive dress or food. The young women I'm talking about are cut from Sarah Palin's cloth, they are the highest number of women in congress today and they define themselves outside of the box. I've had the pleasure of spending some very brief time with Sarah Palin and seeing her in person reacting to those around her. She would be the first person to embrace that young bride and lift her up...not being of the progressive left's eat our own sister variety. Sarah is secure in herself and she passes that on to everyone around her. That's why so many common folk love her...she's n",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Israel (×ž×“×™× ×ª ×™×©×¨××œ) is a small yet diverse Middle Eastern country with a long coastline on the eastern Mediterranean Sea and a small window on the Red Sea at the Gulf of Eilat (Aqaba).
Israel was established as a state for the the Jewish people, following the Second World War. Israel is considered part of the Holy Land (together with areas of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Territories). The three major monotheistic religionsâ€”Judaism, Christianity, and Islamâ€”all have historical ties to the region. Israel thus contains a vibrant modern history and culture, based in part on the diverse, immigrant origins of its inhabitants returning from the Jewish Diaspora. These aspects make Israel a fascinating destination for many travellers and pilgrims.
For Singaporeans, many of us have a warped perception of Israel as a dangerous place to visit because of the frequent news reports of conflicts in the Middle East. When I told my friends and family that I was travelling to Israel, the most common comment I get from those who have not been there is that I should be very careful for my safety.
The worries are unnecessary.
I had a great one week stay at Israel, thanks to the wonderful team from Dig Israel who hosted me there. For the uninformed, Israel is a safe place to visit (excluding the West Bank and Gaza Strip which are not tourist destinations). It is like many other cosmopolitan cities around the world, but with itâ€™s own quirk, diverse culture and people. I will share more about my Israel trip in my subsequent blog posts.
This post is to share some travel tips for Singaporeans who are planning to visit Israel on your own without going through a package tour:
1. Israeli currency â€“ New Israel Shekel
This currency is not easily available outside of Israel, but fret not, you can go to any money changer in Israel to do the exchange. There are counters available at the airport too, but the service fee or â€œcommissionâ€ they charged are quite steep (about S$10+ depending on how much you change). The fee varies from one money changer to another, hence get a few quotes before settling on one to change. The fee charged is a flat fee, hence try to change as much currency as you need just once.
2. Singaporean Passport
If you are holding a Malaysian passport, sorry, you cannot enter Israel. For Singapore passport holders, we do not require a visa. However, request for the Israeli custom officers to stamp on a special piece of immigration paper available at Israel airport instead of stamping directly on your passport. This is because an Israel passport chop may cause difficulties getting into and/or be refused visas to Islamic countries, such as Bangladesh, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan for your subsequent travels.
3. Clearing Israel Custom
The security check is really tight when travelling to Israel. I find it fair enough as it is for our own safety too. You will be asked some profiling questions at the luggage check-in counter travelling to and from Israel. Some of the questions may get a little personal â€“ eg. I was asked questions like why did I only took leave from work one week before my trip; asked to recount my day by day itinerary during my stay in Israel; went through some of my personal photos in my digital camera to check if what I said about my itinerary was true; reasons why I travelled to Malaysia since I been there twice this year and also whether I know anyone there. The questioning may take quite a while and will make some people uncomfortable. My advice is just to answer as honestly as possible if you have nothing to hide. Do not lie to speed up the questioning as they are very thorough and you may end up having to tell another lie to cover a previous harmless lie, increasing the chance of being exposed as a liar and getting detained. You will get to fly. Be patient.
Do not take stuff like soil from Jerusalem and salt from the Dead Sea to pack home on your own. All baggage going out of Israel are screened and opened up for checking. Do not pull stunts like these. Do not take photographs of the security counter and officers either.
The ultra-orthodox Jews are easily identifiable with their curly side burns, black suits and tassels. Tourists like to take pictures of them because of their interesting appearance which we are not familiar with. However, do bear in mind that they are not animals in the zoo and as much as you would get pissed off with strangers taking random pictures of you, they feel the same way too. Do accord them due respect and try not intrude in their personal space.
6. The Sabbath
Be aware of the Sabbath: from Friday sundown to Saturday sundown, train and bus services are not available in Israel (except in Haifa, Nazareth and Eilat, and limited sherut services â€“ shared taxis). Unless you have a car, or are willing to pay for a taxi (not shared), if youâ€™re day tripping on a Friday, you should start thinking about how to get back by noon at the latest, and you should plan on staying near your lodgings on Saturday. Attractions, shops and malls are also closed during the Sabbath. I made the mistake of staying for an additional day in Tel Aviv during the Sabbath and ended up wandering the streets alone with nothing to see or do. I also had to specially advance book a taxi to the airport.
7. Gay and Lesbian Travel
Israel is one of the most â€œgay friendlyâ€ countries in the world. Seriously. All three major cities (Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa) have an annual â€œPrideâ€ parade, and the annual Love Parade in Tel Aviv gets cheering spectators too. Look out for many hotels, cafes and restaurants with rainbow flags hanging outside. These are all gay-friendly places.
Israel is not a cheap country. I find it more expensive than Sydney and the United States in terms of food, lodging and shopping. On average, a meal cost around S$20 for a simple meal at a cafe. A bottle of 500ml water cost around S$5. Taxi from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv one way cost about S$100.
Street food is safe and clean. Israeli cuisine is as diverse as the population which makes up this gastronomic country. Food in Israel is generally of a very high standard. I really enjoyed the food during my stay. Not tipping in sit-in restaurants that have waiters is frowned upon, but is accepted for signalling atrocious service. It is standard to give 10%-15% (or more for exceptional service). 20% tip is considered generous.
Hebrew and Arabic are the official languages of Israel. Hebrew is most commonly spoken. 20% of the population are Israeli-Arabs who speak Arabic as well. English is the most popular foreign language. Israelis study English in school from an early age, and it is commonly understood in Israel. Nearly anyone you meet on the street will be able to communicate with you in English. All street and road signs (and many others) have English names, as well as the Hebrew and Arabic names.

"Average life span in the wild: 12 years
Size: 21 in (50 cm)
Weight: 14.4 oz (408 g)
Did you know? Chameleons don't change colors to match their surroundings. Each species displays distinct color patterns to indicate specific reactions or emotions.
The Meller's chameleon is the largest of the chameleons not native to Madagascar. Their stout bodies can grow to be up to two feet (two-thirds of a meter) long and weigh more than a pound (one-half kilogram).
Meller's distinguish themselves from their universally bizarre-looking cousins with a single small horn protruding from the front of their snouts. This and their size earn them the common name ""giant one-horned chameleon.""
They are fairly common in the savanna of East Africa, including Malawi, northern Mozambique, and Tanzania. Almost one-half of the worldâ€™s chameleons live on the island of Madagascar.
As with all chameleons, Meller's will change colors in response to stress and to communicate with other chameleons. Their normal appearance is deep green with yellow stripes and random black spots. Females are slightly smaller, but are otherwise indistinguishable from males.
They subsist on insects and small birds, using their camouflage and a lightning-fast, catapulting tongue, which can be up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) long, to ambush prey.
Exotic pet enthusiasts often attempt to keep Meller's chameleons as pets. However, they are highly susceptible to even the slightest level of stress and are very difficult to care for in captivity. In the wild, they can live as long as 12 years.",<urn:uuid:9c71b6db-6728-48b5-96b5-05fbc0b5bb4f>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://amazingpicturesoftheanimals.blogspot.com/2012/05/mellers-chameleon-facts-pictures.html,2013-05-18T07:18:54Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.939642549,359,,,,,
"Nuclear Energy in France
Nuclear energy is the cornerstone of french energy policy. In the â€˜70s France chose to develop nuclear as its base load electricity source as a response to the oil crisis and assure its energy independence.
Nuclear Electricity Production: France currently counts 58 commercial nuclear reactors in operation responsible for producing 80% of French domestic electricity. As a comparison, the 104 US reactors produces 20% of US electricity.Despite scarce natural resources, France has reached an energy independence of 50% thanks to its strategic choice for nuclear energy.
Environment: As well as providing safe and reliable energy, nuclear helps to reduce French greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding the release of 31 billions tones of carbon dioxide (contrary to coal or gas generation) and making France the less carbon emitting country within the OECD. As a leader in nuclear energy, France has developed clean technology for radioactive waste disposal. Reprocessing currently allows France to recover valuable elements from spent fuels and permit a significant reduction of high level waste and lead to safer and optimized containment, for final radioactive waste disposition. French nuclear power plants produces only 10 g/year/inhabitant of highly radioactive waste.
International Cooperation and research: France is one of the forerunner in nuclear research and participates in numerous international cooperation programs alongside the United States such as the development of the next generation of nuclear power plants (Gen IV) and the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) that will be built in Cadarache, South of France.
The French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA)
The French Atomic Energy Commission is a public body established in October 1945 by General de Gaulle. It constitutes a power of expertise and proposition for the authorities. A leader in research, development and innovation, the CEA is involved in three main fields:
It develops and acquires the technological building blocks necessary to the development of the nuclear reactors of the future (Contribution to Generation IV and GNEP research),
It contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emission with its research on hydrogen, fuel cells, biomass, energy storageâ€¦,
It supports the nuclear utilities in France by optimizing the nuclear power plants of the French nuclear fleet and by optimizing the fuel cycle,
It offers safe and economically viable technical solutions for managing nuclear waste,
It conducts fundamental research in climate and environmental sciences, high energy physics, astrophysics, fusion, nanosciencesâ€¦
Information and Health technologies:
It tackles micro and nano-technologies for telecommunication and nuclear medicine for radiotherapy and medical imaging,
It researches programs on biotechnology, molecular labelling, biomolecular engineering and structural biology,
It shares its knowledge and know-how through education and training through the National Institute for Nuclear Sciences and Technologies (INSTN),
It manages over 300 priority patents and is active in the creation of clusters.
Defense and National Security:
It conceives, builds, maintains then dismantles the nuclear warhead of the French deterrence force,
It helps to fight against nuclear, biological and chemical weapons (NRBC program).
The missions of the CEA are similar to the Department of Energy in the United States. The CEA has a network of counselor or representatives in French Embassies around the world (see joint map).
The French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN)
Created in 2006, from the former DSIN (Directorate for the Safety of Nuclear Facilities), the French Nuclear Safety Authority is an independent administrative authority which is tasked with regulating nuclear safety and radiation protection in order to protect workers, patients, the public and the environment from the risks involved in nuclear activities. It also contributes to informing the public. Like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the United States, it carries out inspections and may pronounce sanctions, up to and including suspension of operation of an installation.
French Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN)
Created in 2001 by merging the Protection and Nuclear Safety Institute (IPSN) and the Ionizing radiations Protection Office (OPRI), the Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety is a public establishment of an industrial and commercial nature placed under the joint authority of the Ministries of the Environment, Health, Industry, Research and Defense. It is the expert in safety research and specialized assessments into nuclear and radiological risk serving public authorities whose work is complementary to the ASN.
Its scope of activities includes:
environment and response,
human radiological protection,
research on the prevention of major accidents,
power reactor safety,
fuel cycle facility safety,
research installation safety,
waste management safety;
nuclear defense expertise.
National radioactive Waste Management Agency (ANDRA)
Created in 1991, the French National Agency for Radioactive Waste Management is a public industrial and commercial organization that operates independently of waste producers. It is responsible for the long-term management of radioactive waste produced in France under the supervision of the French Ministries for Energy, Research and the Environment. It can be compared to a certain extent to the Office for Nuclear Waste of the Department of Energy in the United States.
Andra also pursues industrial, research, and information activities as it designs and implements disposal solutions suited to each category of radioactive waste:
the collection, conditioning, disposal of radioactive waste from small producers (hospitals, research centers, industry),
specification of waste packages for disposal,
disposal in suited sites,
monitoring of closed disposal facilities,
research programs for long-lived and high level activity waste, especially through the operation of an underground research laboratory in a deep clay formationâ€¦
General Directorate for Energy and Climate (DGEC)
The General Directorate for Energy and Climate represents the government and is part of the Office of the Department for Ecology and Sustainable Development. It defines the French nuclear policy. The DGEC takes care of the energy supply, the security of supply, oil refining and logistics, nuclear industry, and coal and mines.
Consequently, its activities include:
the design and implement energy and raw material supply policy,
to ensure opening of electricity and gas markets,
track key energy and raw material sectors,
to oversee enterprises and public institutions in energy sector,
to ensure compliance with rules and regulations governing energy sector,
to participate in European and international energy projects and working groups,
to provide economic, environmental, and fiscal expertise on energy matters.

"Mexican America - Introduction
""Mexican America"" is a sampling of objects from the collections of the National Museum of American History. The stories behind these objects reflect the history of the Mexican presence in the United States. They illustrate a fundamentally American story about the centuries-old encounter between distinct (yet sometimes overlapping) communities that have coexisted but also clashed over land, culture, and livelihood.
Who, where, and what is Mexico? Over time, the definitions and boundaries of Mexico have changed. The Aztec Empire and the area where NÃ¡hautl was spokenâ€”today the region surrounding modern Mexico Cityâ€”was known as Mexico. For 300 years, the Spanish colonizers renamed it New Spain.
When Mexico was reborn in 1821 as a sovereign nation, its borders stretched from California to Guatemala. It was a huge and ancient land of ethnically, linguistically, and economically diverse regions that struggled for national unity. Texas, (then part of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas) was a frontier region far from the dense cities and fertile valleys of central Mexico, a place where immigrants were recruited from the United States. The immigrants in turn declared the Mexican territory an independent republic in 1836 (later a U.S. state), making the state the first cauldron of Mexican American culture. By 1853, the government of Mexico, the weaker neighbor of an expansionist United States, had lost what are today the states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming. In spite of the imposition of a new border, the historical and living presence of Spaniards, Mexicans, indigenous peoples, and their mixed descendants remained a defining force in the creation of the American West.
â€œLa AmÃ©rica Mexicanaâ€ es una muestra conformada por objetos provenientes de las distintas colecciones del Museo Nacional de Historia Americana. Estos objetos reflejan la historia de la presencia mexicana en los Estados Unidos e ilustran una crÃ³nica fundamentalmente americana acerca del encuentro centenario entre comunidades diferentes que han coexistido, pero que tambiÃ©n se han enfrentado, en la pugna por la tierra, la cultura y el sustento.
Â¿QuiÃ©n, dÃ³nde y quÃ© es MÃ©xico? Con el transcurso del tiempo, las definiciones y los lÃ­mites de MÃ©xico han ido cambiando. Se conocÃ­a como MÃ©xico al Imperio Azteca y toda el Ã¡rea donde se hablaba nÃ¡huatl â€”actualmente la regiÃ³n circundante a la ciudad de MÃ©xico. Durante 300 aÃ±os los colonizadores espaÃ±oles se refirieron a ella como Nueva EspaÃ±a. Cuando en 1821 MÃ©xico resurgiÃ³ como una naciÃ³n soberana, sus fronteras se extendÃ­an desde California a Guatemala. En ese entonces era un antiguo e inmenso territorio conformado por regiones Ã©tnica, lingÃ¼Ã­stica y econÃ³micamente diversas que luchaban por adquirir unidad nacional. Texas (en ese entonces parte de los estados mexicanos de Coahuila y Tejas) era una regiÃ³n fronteriza lejos de las densas urbes y de los fÃ©rtiles valles de MÃ©xico central, donde se reclutaban inmigrantes de los Estados Unidos. En el aÃ±o 1836 este territorio mexicano se declarÃ³ como repÃºblica independiente (y mÃ¡s tarde, estado de EE.UU.), convirtiÃ©ndose en el primer calderÃ³n de la cultura mexicoamericana. Hacia 1853, el gobierno de MÃ©xico, el vecino dÃ©bil de un Estados Unidos en expansiÃ³n, habÃ­a perdido el territorio de los actuales estados de California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Nuevo MÃ©xico, Texas y partes de Colorado y Wyoming. A pesar de la imposiciÃ³n de un nuevo lÃ­mite fronterizo, la presencia histÃ³rica y ocupacional de los espaÃ±oles, mexicanos y pueblos indÃ­genas, junto a sus descendientes mestizos, constituirÃ­a a lo largo del tiempo una influencia determinante para el desarrollo del Oeste Americano.

- This print depicts American forces attacking the fortress palace of Chapultepec on Sept. 13th, 1847. General Winfield Scott, in the lower left on a white horse, led the southern division of the U.S. Army that successfully captured Mexico City during the Mexican American War. The outcome of American victory was the loss of Mexico's northern territories, from California to New Mexico, by the terms set in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. It should be noted that the two countries ratified different versions of the same peace treaty, with the United States ultimately eliminating provisions for honoring the land titles of its newly absorbed Mexican citizens. Despite notable opposition to the war from Americans like Abraham Lincoln, John Quincy Adams, and Henry David Thoreau, the Mexican-American War proved hugely popular. The United States' victory boosted American patriotism and the country's belief in Manifest Destiny.
- This large chromolithograph was first distributed in 1848 by Nathaniel Currier of Currier and Ives, who served as the ""sole agent."" The lithographers, Sarony & Major of New York (1846-1857) copied it from a painting by ""Walker."" Unfortunately, the current location of original painting is unknown, however, when the print was made the original painting was owned by a Captain B. S. Roberts of the Mounted Rifles. The original artist has previously been attributed to William Aiken Walker as well as to Henry A. Walke. William Aiken Walker (ca 1838-1921) of Charleston did indeed do work for Currier and Ives, though not until the 1880's and he would have only have been only 10 years old when this print was copyrighted. Henry Walke (1808/9-1896) was a naval combat artist during the Mexican American War who also worked with Sarony & Major and is best known for his Naval Portfolio.
- Most likely the original painting was done by James Walker (1819-1889) who created the ""Battle of Chapultepec"" 1857-1862 for the U.S. Capitol. This image differs from the painting commissioned for the U. S. Capitol by depicting the troops in regimented battle lines with General Scott in a more prominent position in the foreground. James Walker was living in Mexico City at the outbreak of the Mexican War and joined the American forces as an interpreter. He was attached to General Worth's staff and was present at the battles of Contreras, Churubusco, and Chapultepec. The original painting's owner, Captain Roberts was assigned General Winfield Scott to assist Walker with recreating the details of the battle of Chapultepec. When the painting was complete, Roberts purchased the painting. By 1848, James Walker had returned to New York and had a studio in New York City in the same neighborhood as the print's distributor Nathaniel Currier as well as the lithographer's Napoleon Sarony and Henry B. Major.
- This popular lithograph was one of several published to visually document the war while engaging the imagination of the public. Created prior to photography, these prints were meant to inform the public, while generally eliminating the portrayal of the more gory details. Historians have been able to use at least some prints of the Mexican War for study and to corroborate with the traditional literary forms of documentation. As an eyewitness, Walker could claim accuracy of detail within the narrative in his painting. The battle is presented in the grand, historic, heroic style with the brutality of war not portrayed. The print depiction is quite large for a chromo of the period. In creating the chromolithographic interpretation of the painting, Sarony & Major used at least four large stones to produce the print ""in colours,"" making the most of their use of color. They also defined each figure with precision by outlining each in black. This print was considered by expert/collector Harry T. Peters as one of the finest ever produced by Sarony & Major.

"American Printer's mission is to be the most reliable and authoritative source of information on integrating tomorrow's technology with today's management.
Jul 1, 2006 12:00 AM
Following the recent release of QuarkXPress 7, graphic arts managers and other technology decisionmakers are asking two primary questions:
Quark has revamped its previously troubled color management system with some success. There are four fundamental changes:
Command central for QuarkXPress 7â€™s color management is
the Color Manager, located in Preferences. Whether it is good to
always have color management on can (and will be) argued both ways.
For savvy production color users, itâ€™s probably a good thing,
as ultimately it forces us to make color decisions that we should
be making anyway. For those with limited color experience, the
quality and consequences of the QuarkXPress 7 default settings will
determine the output results. Learn how to config-ure the source
and output settings (Edit menu) and apply them through the Color
Manager (Preferences) and/or the Job Jackets Manager (more on this
The source/output setting separation is a welcome change. Users can control specifically which color profiles and rendering intents will be used for viewing and converting the color in your images. For many this will involve using the same profiles and intents used elsewhere, such as in Adobe Photoshop. You also have access to the same color system-stored profiles as those accessed in Photoshop, as well as the Quark-specific profiles stored in Quarkâ€™s application folder. If you pay attention, you should be able to keep your color consistent as you move your images through QuarkXPress.
For those of you anxiously wondering about using your previous color settings that you know how to print, breathe easy. You can select QuarkXPress Emulate Legacy for your source and Output settings, and ColorSync or ICM for your color management module (CMM), if you want to just pass the old values through. The most obvious opening for color divergence is if you convert colors through QuarkXPress using a CMM different than one you use elsewhere.
The third major color management change is Quarkâ€™s
adoption of LogoSync CMM. The CMM is the engine that actually
handles the conversion of the color values from one color profile
space to another color profile space. Using LogoSync is an overall
improvement, but it has built-in limitations, as well. Switching
from OS-based ColorSync or ICM to LogoSync (for the default CMM) is
a good move for two reasons. First, using LogoSync provides more
cross-platform compatibility not available when ColorSync was used
on the Mac. Second, ICM is used in Windows. The limitations of both
ColorSync and ICM are widely acknowledged, so other CMMs have been
adopted widely. LogoSync (developed with GretagMacbeth) is an
acknowledged high quality CMM. The inherent limitation of using
LogoSync is that it currently is not widely used. In print
production the most widely used CMM is the Adobe (ACE) CMM. There
are those who argue LogoSync is a better CMM than Adobe (ACE) CMM.
Even if this is true, it is largely irrelevant to the discussion of
consistency. And there is little Quark can do about this, as it
does not have access to the Adobe (ACE) CMM. So until either Adobe
releases its Adobe (ACE) CMM for third-party use or another CMM
(such as LogoSync) becomes the commonly used standard, this
inconsistency in color conversion will exist. How visible the
differences in the conversion results will be will depend upon the
images, color profiles and rendering intents used.
Bypass color conversion problems by performing the conversions in another application (such as Adobe Photoshop) and assigning the same color profiles for Source and Output in QuarkXPress that you have in Photoshop.
The other major changeâ€”a good oneis the ability to soft proof nondestructively using color profiles and rendering intents. Quarkâ€™s soft proofing is similar to InDesignâ€™s soft proofing with a View menu Output Control. Also like InDesign, QuarkXPress now lets users view and change image-specific color profile and rendering intent via Window > Profile information.
So whatâ€™s the bottom line? Here are my conclusions:
One caveat: This .psd import capability doesnâ€™t seem to work well with layers modified by Photoshop CS2 Layer Styles. When I imported a CS2 .psd image containing layer styles, I consistently received an error message indicating that layer effects were not supported. But when this occurred, the .psd image still was imported and access and editing still was provided to those layers and channel components that were supported. (Perhaps the PSD Import feature was developed and tested with CS1 images.)
Picture effects provide for a variety of picture editing tools, including curves, sharpening, blurring and many more. Once applied, these effects adjustments can be stored and reused. I remain a staunch supporter of making these corrections directly in an image editing application such as Photoshop. Nonetheless, this could be a time-saving production tool when working with client files whose images all need the same amount of lightening or sharpening. You could apply the effect once, record that adjustment and then apply it to as many other images as are required.
You even can share picture effects files. InDesign does not offer a similaralry powerful image-editing tool. Picture Effects currently does not work with Photoshop images, a frustrating mismatch with the .psd import function.
Keyboard shortcuts are a mixed bag. QuarkXPress historically has provided the more logical and elegant keyboard shortcut sets and sequences. Its use of the â€œMâ€ series as well as its control of type size, tracking, kerning and leading still is the best around. But InDesign now offers a custom dialog (Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts) that allows you to assign your own keyboard shortcuts, reassign others, create sets of shortcuts and even use QuarkXPress and PageMaker shortcuts. Quark still has the fundamentally superior set of shortcuts, but it is resting on its laurels. InDesign offers an increasing number of shortcuts common to multiple CS applications, so itâ€™s a tie in this category.
Measurements palette vs. control palette
The enhanced measurements palette is the most immediately obvious interface change in QuarkXPress 7. It has a new context-sensitive pop-up subpalette that offers many of the control features previously found only in other dialogs and palettes.
This is Quarkâ€™s answer to InDesignâ€™s multifaceted control palettes.The new measurement palette is well designed and easier to decipher than InDesignâ€™s implementation of a context-sensitive palette. If you just donâ€™t like any of this context-sensitive sophistication, click on the Quark logo icon on the far left of the pop-up palette, and you will see your familiar old measurement palette.
Master pages, style sheets, text import and
No important changes have been made to master pages or style sheets in version 7. InDesign remains master of those realms.
In addition, InDesign offers multiple baseline grids (through text frame baselines) and boasts a complete and sophisticated Word document import feature for controlling the import, autoformatting and appending of style sheets from Word and .rtf documents, which QuarkXPress still lacks.
Output styles vs. print presets
Quark has one-upped Adobe in the print styles category, where Quarkâ€™s print style was roughly equivalent to InDesignâ€™s Print Presets. QuarkXPressâ€™ new output style (Edit > Output Styles) is like print styles on steroidsâ€”it includes resolution-specific transparency flattening, metadata and JDF info, as well as standard print dialog settings.
Output styles have three initial default setups for PDF, Print and EPS (whose settings now include the ability to embed font files in EPS files). Output styles can be shared and are integrated into the powerful job jackets function, as well.
QuarkXPress 7 has stuck with JAWS as its PDF Export function. While Quark has done extensive testing with the new and improved version of JAWS, I remain unconvinced of the consistent usability of JAWS-generated PDFs in prepress. (Besides, it is slower than molasses flowing in January.) I still recommend printing PostScript from QuarkXPress to Distiller-watched folders for generating prepress-bound PDFs. Again Adobe has an inherent advantage, because it owns PDF and Distiller. Quark does provide an easy and Preference-selectable avenue to PostScript and Distiller.
One of Quarkâ€™s most comprehensive and sophisticated new production tools is the implementation of job jackets, including the Job Jackets Manager (Utilities > Job Jackets Manager). Job jackets are complete descriptions of allâ€”and I mean ALLâ€”the characteristics of a job. Jobs can be defined at three levels:
Once defined, job jackets can be used in multiple ways. A job
jacket can be used to create a new job using all the predefined
characteristics of that job jacket (File > New > Project From
Ticket). Job jackets also can be used to evaluate an existing job
(File > Job Jacket > Evaluate Layout). This job evaluation
amounts to a sophisticated preflighting tool that allows you to
look for a wide range of intimate project and component
characteristics, such as image resolution, file format, image color
space and attached color profiles. QuarkXPress documents also can
be output using job jackets or tickets. Instead of selecting File
> Print, you can choose to define and control your output via
the job jacket by selecting File > Output Job, selecting a
specific set of output specifications defined in a ticket template,
including previously created output styles. InDesign doesnâ€™t
offer this powerful production tool.
Now for a reality check: The good news is that the job jacket function is robust, full-featured and highly integrated into QuarkXPress 7; the bad news is that the job jacket function has a complex and somewhat quirky (non-QuarkXPress-like) interface that is difficult to learn. I see this function initially being configured by print shop techies who will then train larger clients to use them.
The bottom line
If you are a QuarkXPress user, I think you will be delighted with version 7 and I recommend upgrading. Keep a copy of 6.5 available, too. I also recommend installing QuarkXPress 7 first on a test system partition or drive identical to your working system, as a precaution, to ensure the installation process does not cause any unexpected system problems. The bottom line: QuarkXPress 7 is a welcome update with some very powerful new tools and features.
Talk to the hand
Whenever I am working in QuarkXPress, I love that I donâ€™t have to remember which of the two keyboard shortcuts I am supposed to use (depending upon whether I am working with an active text tool or not) for accessing the hand tool.
If I were king of Adobe, that is the first thing I would fix: One keyboard shortcut for accessing the hand tool! Then, while I was at it, I would change the names of the two selection tools to â€œobjectâ€ and â€œcontentâ€ tools.
So long to PostScript?
By Julie Shaffer
The Adobe PDF Print Engine is a new printing platform (a.k.a. RIP) that directly renders PDF files. Many print/prepress workflow solutions on the market today are based on Adobe CPSI RIP technology, which is built on PostScript. Even solutions that use PDF as an internal working file format, such as Kodak Prinergy, Agfa Apogee and Heidelberg PrintReady, still convert those PDF files to PostScript prior to actual imaging.
But PostScript 3 was introduced in 1997. It canâ€™t natively render some newer effects, like transparency, which have become design mainstays. Transparency has to be flattened prior to introducing it to PostScript and, depending on how and where this flattening is done, the results can look terrible. Adobeâ€™s PDF Print Engine eliminates all such problems because it renders those PDF files natively.
The technology also incorporates JDF information for job control, so it will fit nicely into the â€œend-to-endâ€ workflow solutions.
Adobe still will support PostScriptâ€”it wonâ€™t suddenly vanish. But the next evolution is here.

"Few things have been more poorly understood about the Obama administration than its foreign policy. Partisan and ideological blinders have tended to obscure and distort how critics and supporters have interpreted his policy decisions and his reactions to events around the world. More hawkish interventionists have fixated on Obamaâ€™s diplomatic overtures to authoritarian states, his condemnation of Manuel Zelayaâ€™s deposition, and his slightly firmer line on Israeli settlements as proof of weakness and perfidy, while realists and liberals have great confidence that the same represents a significant positive departure from past policy, but both are finding more in these moves than is really there. This has led to a number of misconceptions about how to classify the Obama administrationâ€™s foreign policy inclinations, and it has created confusion in how we should judge the administrationâ€™s performance in improving relations with much of the rest of the world.
What continues to confuse observers on both sides is the remarkableâ€”or perhaps depressingâ€”continuity between the Obama and Bush administrations in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy, which is usually acknowledged only when it suits the rhetorical purposes of an argument. Critics and supporters alike would rather emphasize a dialectical relationship between the two administrations in which Obama is the antithesis of Bush for good or ill, which permits discredited neoconservative interventionists to describe any Obama failures as the repudiation of realism, their traditional bÃªte noire, and allows realists and liberals to rediscover the virtues of U.S. hegemony by confusing change in management with change in policy.
This continuity necessarily thwarts any attempt to find a consistent theme or pattern to the administrationâ€™s actions, and it renders criticisms of a lack of consistency moot. That has not stopped critics from trying to find grand, unifying explanations of Obamaâ€™s actions, such as perceiving a â€œpro-dictator,â€ â€œanti-democratic,â€ or â€œanti-Americanâ€ pattern in Obamaâ€™s responses to the Honduran constitutional crisis and Iranian elections, but these are unsupported claims. No administration will ever pursue any policy with anything like perfect consistency, and Obamaâ€™s predecessor was no exception, so we should expect the same consistency or lack thereof from an administration that has largely followed in its predecessorâ€™s footsteps. Indeed, the difficulty of pursuing a policy consistently draws more attention to the flaws of the policy than to an undesirable lack of consistency.
No matter how idealistic and ideological an administration may be, there are structures and interests that limit how any administration can act: Every â€˜freedom agendaâ€™ must have its exceptions for Arab dictators and anti-Russian demagogues, every non-proliferation regime must have its exceptions for allied nuclear states outside of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and every â€˜war on terrorâ€™ must make room for or at least overlook the sponsorship of terrorism by allied governments. For that matter, there may also be longtime allies that find themselves at odds with major multilateral organizations, as the Honduran transitional government recently has, in which case Washington may end up siding with the latter as part of its regional or global â€œleadershipâ€ role. So a lack of consistency in administration policy by itself is neither praiseworthy nor damningâ€”it is what the reality of international affairs imposes on even the most zealous ideologue.
Inasmuch as Wilsonian idealism has permeated both parties especially since the end of the Cold War, the criticisms that partisan opponents level at a given administration will typically be framed in terms of the administrationâ€™s failures or disinterest in promoting democracy, and the administrationâ€™s defenders will stress its overriding democratist goals. Once again, we have debates over means rather than ends. We have seen this nowhere more clearly than in the domestic reactions to Obamaâ€™s handling of the Iranian elections. Whether or not Obamaâ€™s domestic critics were genuinely interested in the plight of Iranâ€™s reformers, whom many hawkish interventionists had previously derided as fundamentally no different from their hard-line rivals, they took up the cause of the Iranian protesters and demanded more forceful rhetoric and action from the president, who resisted calls to insert himself into what was an entirely internal Iranian matter.
When Obama did not heed their calls, hawkish critics were furious about the â€œbetrayal of democracyâ€ that this represented. However, even as he said little and did less in response to Tehranâ€™s crackdown, Obama wanted to emphasize that his restraint was the best means of aiding Iranian dissidents. This may be true, given past U.S. interference in domestic Iranian politics and the regimeâ€™s mockery of the protests as a phony U.S.-backed â€œcolorâ€ revolution, but the crucial point is that Obama felt compelled to explain his restraint in these terms. More than that, his aides reportedly wanted to credit the presidentâ€™s earlier speech in Cairo with sparking the apparent late surge for Moussavi as a way of emphasizing the importance of soft power in shaping public opinion. In other words, the new administration wanted it known that regime change in Tehran and democracy promotion in Muslim countries, two ideas for which the previous administration was quite properly criticized as overly ideological and detached from reality, were still very much a part of U.S. policy despite any apparent changes to the contrary.
Classifications of foreign policy schools or inclinations are never precise, whether they are applied to the thinking of individuals or entire administrations, as most policymakers combine elements from different schools and will tend to adapt their use of diplomatic, political, and military tools to changing circumstances. As we recall from the preparation for the Iraq war and the slight shifts made during the second Bush term, even inside the Bush administration one would find conflicting views and changes in the presidentâ€™s own thinking over time. It is also important to bear in mind that these classifications tend to bleed into one another in practice, which is a function of the broad bipartisan consensus about the legitimacy and necessity of the projection of American power around the world, the preservation of U.S. military and political supremacy, the promotion of liberal democratic values, and the inevitability of American global leadership. Most foreign policy debates take place within these fairly narrow boundaries, and the points of contention are questions of means rather than ends.
This practical blurring of lines between foreign policy schools is also the result of widely shared cultural-political convictions that Andrew Bacevich has called the â€œideology of national security,â€ which is the belief that expanding freedom (however vaguely or loosely defined) is the purpose of history and the mission of the U.S., that American actions abroad serve this purpose, and that both American freedom and security are bound up in ensuring universal freedom. While such ideas are normally associated today with neoconservatives or â€œhard Wilsonianâ€ idealists, it is fair to say that this ideology is the foundation of the bipartisan consensus just described, and most internationalistsâ€”which is to say most Americans who spend any time thinking about foreign policyâ€”partake of it to some extent.
Obama sympathizers have fixated on superficial changes in style and tone in the hopes that they represent some significant shift in policy, and enemies have discovered proof of sinister plots in the same ultimately trivial gestures. Thus Obamaâ€™s â€˜recognitionâ€™ of the Iranian government by using its formal title of Islamic Republic, or the initial gestures connected with â€œresettingâ€ the relationship with Russia, or even something as unremarkable as acknowledging the American role in the overthrow of Mossadegh in 1953 are taken as powerful signals one way or the other: as exciting openings to rapprochement or pathetic instances of weakness and capitulation. As it happens, the truth is far simpler than either of these interpretations allows.
For all of the praiseâ€”and abuseâ€”the administration has received for its greater realism, it clearly remains committed to halting Iranâ€™s nuclear program by any means available and to unnecessary, provocative NATO expansion into former Soviet space, even though both policies expose the U.S. to many more costs and risks rather than fewer. For all of the talk of engagement and â€œreset,â€ the substance of our Iran and Russia policies has not changed under the new administration, and it never was going to change greatly. The administration believed that it could extract concessions and aid from these states through negotiations, but it never intended to alter its behavior toward them. The president still presumes to dictate the security and energy policies of other states, and he still insists on extending our sphere of influence to Russiaâ€™s borders in the name of eliminating spheres of influence. Whichever name one wants to give to this sort of foreign policy, it remains inexplicably aggressive, hegemonic, and dangerous to U.S. interests, and it is all the more so because it comes wrapped in a veil of diplomatic gestures and the pretense of repairing damaged relations.

"Route: (40I-) MGY-I19-MGY
Weather: Overcast, 28 degrees, wind 200 degrees at 6 knots
With 269 landings, five months of training, nearly 75 flight hours, plenty of frustration, tons of fun, at least $6000 spent, and so many great memories behind me... I'm a Private Pilot! The weather cooperated and I went up with the examiner to complete the flying portion of my checkride, following last weekend's oral exam. Everything went well and I didn't feel any nerves aside from a little hope that I wouldn't make any boneheaded mistakes. Luckily, I did not. I am now the proud holder of a Temporary Airman Certificate, good until my plastic FAA certificate arrives in the mail.
As I did with the oral exam, I'll share the details of the checkride below. And make sure you read the end of the post, as I got to deal with some serious craziness when I went to leave Wright Brothers.
- I arrived at Stewart early in order to get a weather briefing, compute my weight and balance, and make sure I had all the paperwork in order. Then I had some help in starting the plane (it takes some extra work when it's 15 degrees out at night - brr!) and I let it warm up for a couple minutes. Fuel full, I left around 12:15 and got in a few practice landings at Wright Brothers before my scheduled 1:00 appointment with the examiner. Having not practiced a no-flap landing, I made one there and it was incredibly smooth. My landings felt great last night and today, hopefully a good sign for today.
- After a quick look through my papers, we walked out to the plane and he asked me to do a preflight as if it were the first flight of the day. I walked around the plane and made my usual inspection, mentioning what I was doing on a couple occasions but for the most part not saying much. It looked like the examiner was just looking over to make sure I checked everything important. He told me he was going to get into the little 150 when I was about 2/3 of the way through the inspection. Both in the plane, I went through the pre-start checklist and got the engine running. He told me that I was PIC (Pilot in Command) so I would be responsible for the flight and should call out all traffic to him. I ran through the CIGAR checklist on the ramp (minus the runup) and then taxied down to the runup area at the end of the runway. During the runup I called out as I checked the suction (which I do even when I fly solo) and mags ""left, drop, both, right, drop, both..."" and declared us ready to fly.
- He asked me to make a normal takeoff and then proceed on course, which was about due East to our destination in Clarksburg, WV. The takeoff was very smooth and I got to pattern altitude and turned downwind. He asked what the heck I was doing. Crap, stupid move there. I should have departed on a 45 degree heading from the takeoff runway and instead flew downwind for some stupid reason. We do use that departure at Stewart sometimes, but honestly I just totally didn't have my brain connected. No big deal, he just explained to me the reasons for specific departures and I overflew the airport and then departed on the proper 155 degree heading. Phwew.
- Leveling off at 3,500 feet, he said I should pitch over and build up speed before pulling back the throttle. I don't know if I was taught to throttle back while leveling off or if I just invented the habit on my own, but a good idea that I'll use in the future. We were about due South of Xenia at this point (meaning we had traveled all of 10ish miles) and he had me descend to 2,500 feet and divert to Green County Airport (I19). I know you never fly much of the cross-country you plan for the checkride, but that sure was short.
- Using my sectional, I found the frequency for I19 and entered the pattern on a 45 degree entry. He asked for a normal landing so I set up for that, starting the descent abeam the numbers on downwind. I've heard from local pilots the winds are interesting on Runway 25 because it's at the edge of a 100 foot slope down to a road and gravel pit. I anticipated that on short final but I didn't feel much. The landing was smooth but as soon as I touched down he jerked the yoke and said to get the ailerons into the wind, which was about 4 knots and 20 degrees off the nose. Doesn't seem like much but he said a lot of pilots have had the wing get under their wings because they don't think a light crosswind can do anything. Point noted sir.
- Short field takeoffs and landings were next. The takeoff went great and I set up for an extended downwind for the landing. He told me to name my point and I said I'd touch down on the numbers. I ended up landing within a few feet of the numbers, although it was not the smoothest touchdown in my piloting career. But I landed slow and short as required, so all was well. I departed Greene County with a soft field takeoff (went well) and we turned to the South.
- I was instructed to pick a point to turn around and said I'd use a barn in a field below. He asked what the most important thing in starting a ground reference maneuver is. ""Enter on the downwind side?"" ""No!"" ""Uh, avoid populated areas?"" ""No!"" And so it went for a couple more things I muttered out, not sure what he wanted to hear. ""To have an available emergency landing area!"" Oh, duh. Although I guess it's never been something that was specifically discussed. Not that the first barn was in rough terrain or anything but there were other houses nearby. So I picked out a barn surrounded on all four sides by large fields and made a very smooth and otherwise uneventful turn around it. That was it for ground reference maneuvers.
- ""Your engine just died."" Pitch to best glide... ""What are you doing?"" ""Pitching to best glide."" ""No! You ALWAYS PULL THE CARB HEAT FIRST!!!"" Alrighty then. I swear I was taught to always pitch down first, but his point was that the carb heat will cool down in 3-5 seconds so if you don't get it on right away there will be no heat left to help. He then proceeded to pull the power on me about 3 more times in a row to make sure I yanked that carb heat out instantly. Then he left the throttle out for good and had me descend to a field, drop the flaps to 40 degrees when clear of the barn/trees, and get down to maybe 50 feet above the ground. That's the lowest I have ever gone in a practice engine-out situation and I know I would have made a survivable landing if necessary. At this point, he took control of the plane and got us out of there while I put the hood on for instrument work.
- The hood work seemed to go by very quickly. I climbed and turned to headings he assigned, pretty basic stuff. Then came brain disconnect number two. He had me punch in a frequency and fly directly to the VOR. The needle was centered on a 125 degree heading TO and asked if I was flying to the station. ""Yes."" ""Uh, are you sure?"" Took me a second to take my brain out of neutral and I looked at the heading indicator and saw we were heading 280. So obviously I had to turn to track the radial to the station. Again, a random stupid mistake that he thankfully gave me a second to think about and correctly answer. Then my head went down and he had me do two unusual attitude recoveries. I was surprised at how he put us into the unusual attitudes, as it was way smoother than with Joe or Dave. Both of them really threw the plane all over the place to screw me up before handing the controls back over. The first recovery was from nose-high and the second was from a pretty steep downward spiral. I quickly recovered on both and that was it for the hood work.
- Able to look out the window again, I climbed up to 3,000 for steep turns and stalls. The turns went great, with a 360 to the left followed immediately by a 360 to the right. He covered up the altimeter but I saw I was within about 25-50 feet of my starting point when I finished the whole maneuver. I saw a plane about 500 feet above us during the turns and I called that out as I kept moving along, probably a mark in my favor since I was obviously keeping my eyes scanning. He then asked for a power on stall in a takeoff configuration so I slowed to 60 knots, added full power, and pulled back to induce the stall and recovered. However, he said I was looking too much at the sky out the front and not enough to the sides and consequently added in a little aileron without realizing. We went thru a series of power-on stalls as he demonstrated some different things and I did a few more. Then I went into the landing configuration with 40 degrees of flaps and made a couple power-off stalls. All the stalls went relatively well but he was really harping on me to make sure I only used the rudder to avoid a spin or steep spiral.
- Hard to believe, but he told me to fly us back to Wright Brothers and make a soft field landing. We were out over Caesar Creek Lake at this point, so in flying the 5-10 minutes back we talked about random flying stuff for a bit. I spotted some planes over Stewart as I was descending. Then I entered the pattern at MGY and made an interesting soft field landing. I did touch town softly but I was drifting (not enough crosswind correction with the aileron) and floated a bit before finally getting the thing down. I didn't like it, but he obviously was satisfied as he told me to taxi back to parking. Once I shut 60338 shut down he hopped out and told me to meet him back inside, where he printed up my temporary certificate. We only flew for 1.3 hours (including probably 0.4 in taxi time on the ground) but I did enough to earn my wings!
Happy and excited to return to Stewart as a Private Pilot, I quickly preflighted the plane and started her up. I taxied down to Runway 20, did my runup, and announced my takeoff on the CTAF. ""Cessna departing Wright Brothers, runway is closed!"" Uhh, what? Somewhere in the couple of minutes between engine start and now a Cessna 210 landed gear-up and they closed the airport. First things first, everyone in the plane was fine unless you're counting bruised egos. I never heard them call in the traffic pattern, so I must have been looking down or checking the AWOS at just the right moment to miss them fly by. Obviously I would have yelled out ""gear up, gear up!"" on the radio if I had seen them. The runway has slight hump in it, so I couldn't even see the plane sitting down there until I taxied down the runway and back to the ramp.
Even though I would have been long airborne before passing the plane (it was 3,500 feet down the runway) the airport was now legally closed. I didn't think it would be wise to get my certificate revoked all of 30 minutes after receiving it by knowingly departing from a closed airport. It ended up taking a couple hours to get the proper FAA/NTSB approval for a crane to lift the plane up so they could flick the switch to lower the gear and tow the plane off the runway. By the time that was complete, it was dark out. I can legally fly at night, but Stewart doesn't allow landings at night except by CFIs. So Dave ended up driving over to pick me up and they'll send someone over in the morning to fly the plane back. Not the triumphant return flight I had hoped for post-checkride but it was quite the interesting thing to witness. Plus, I was able to talk to a few other stranded pilots while we sat around for a couple hours waiting.
I'll close with a quick thanks to all of you who have been reading this blog over the past five months and sharing in the experience with me. All your comments, thoughts, suggestions and friendship has meant a lot to me and I feel lucky to have had all your support. Now it's time for us all to hop in our planes and meet up somewhere.

"Jodi had another good night and is doing well this morning. In fact, for the first time the physical therapist has come in for some ""real"" exercise. Of course, it isn't much, but a little bit of anything will be a lot more than what she has had. She's doing shoulder shrugs right now. Now she's pushing her shoulders back into the pillow. She's now stretching her arms out to each side. You get the idea.
There is still no evidence of any spinal fluid leaking. That is great! They kept the lumbar drain going at 15cc's all through the night, which was different than the plan yesterday. They've clamped the drain ocmpletely as of this morning, which is also different from what was discussed yesterday. We don't understand why these changes. We've asked the nurse to page the doctor to make sure things are being done properly. Hopefully, the sealing over of the hole will hold through this rapid increase in pressure and with the increase in physical activity.
Sherri called this morning to tell Jodi that Trenden was fasting again today. This makes three days in a row. Sherri told him it would be okay to eat, especially since he'd fasted yesterday and the day before. He looked at his Grandma Orgill and said, ""I'm going to fast for however long it takes!"" What a demonstration of love and faith by a 10 year old for his Mom. We can all learn from his sweet and touching example.
I'll keep you posted throughout the day as to Jodi's progress. Things are looking good enough that the routine of laying in bed while being loaded up with pain medication is changing quickly.

"Three years ago Karen and I headed north up the Hudson River to check out the ice. This winter has been so mild, I doubt thereâ€™s much ice to look at on the Hudson. So to find ice we had to go fartherâ€”to QuÃ©bec City and the St. Lawrence River.
The evening we arrived we climbed up to the Plains of Abraham for a big-picture view of the river. I donâ€™t think you can see how cold it was, but you can see the wind on the water:
The next day we decided to get a close-up view of the ice, and we took the ferry across to LÃ©vis. You can see the ferry at the bottom of the picture above. The ice was pretty thick, and the ferry had to push through the floes.

Many of us (I being one of them) consider that LF may be one of the last frontiers
of _experimental_ ham radio . Lots of (if not most) things have been done in HF and
VHF. In Microwave, most experiments may have to do with using either old Navy or
Air Force equipment, and very expensive test equipment.LF, on the other hand, has
the advantage of needing only very simple equipment. Any old 'scope will do, almost
any bulb will work as a test load, and almost any amplifier will perform at 136
kHz. It remains that one really has to reconsider everything one does. How does an
antenna which is << lambda really work? How do we reduce the QRM to a minimum?

I don't know anybody who's bought the satellite antennas, but I do know some guys who've bought the recent HF antennas.
Quality control is typical MFJ, with parts missing, holes drilled wrong, poor instructions, etc.
I tend to be gun shy with about 90% of MFJ products. I know too many people that have been burned by their stuff. Some of their products are good, but their QC is *always* suspect. My antenna analyzer works perfectly, but then I cross my fingers every time I put the batteries in it!

"Did I tell you. . .
Owen is walking?! Last week he had his 11 month milestone and it seemed to be the day he decided to walk.

My girls all walked by their first birthday but Owen has been a bit early in the movement department in relation to them. Either he really wants to chase them or he just has a bit more coordination and muscle. Heâ€™s just too much fun.

Been turning to painting this week as I am trying to get settled down here. I always take the ease of our lives in the states for granted. How quickly things manifest. How fluid it can be to accomplish things, get services and problem solve. I am humbled this week as I take baby steps to getting an office up and running here. But a little fish and rice, some long salt water swims and a few bike rides keep the process in perspective. This is a work in progress I've used as a touchstone this week. Still getting warmed up. I think I found a man to build me canvases- woohoo! Luxury at it's best. Kiss your art supply stores and Target's for me y'all.
I've just finished a lovely weekend here in San Diego. This weekend Emily Falconridge was our host while I offered up tips and ideas to a wonderful group of women. We did Mixed Media Mandala's and Funky Wallpaper People. It's been a whirlwind flying in from Belize and heading back tomorrow. San Diego seems more vibrant than ever and the perfect place to make some fresh artwork and connect in a workshop. Thank you to everyone who made the trek and effort to come this weekend! I'll be loading up with three suitcases full of paints, papers and canvas so that I can keep the artsy love flowing from Central America until I head out of the island thicket and head to the (Arcangelo Productions) Bali retreat in March!
Tomorrow is the leap day. Taking off for the that lovely turquoise sea. Thank God for having this blog and this community. I will cherish this place of connection while I am away and it will be a touchstone when I am cut off from life as usual.

"Buffalo MiniStation Thunderbolt Review - An External with USB 3.0 and Thunderboltby Brian Klug on August 1, 2012 4:04 PM EST
Back when Thunderbolt (then Intel Lightpeak) was optical, I was actively involved in covering the interface, partly out of professional curiosity due to my optical background, partly because I sincerely believe optical interfaces are an inevitable part of the future. When Lightpeak became Thunderbolt and lost the optical layer, it fell under Anandâ€™s beat and the Mac umbrella. I acquired a MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt somewhere around the same time, but never acquired any Thunderbolt peripherals or drives. Since then, Thunderbolt has slowly but surely gained traction with more and more peripherals and host devices. Initial adoption was glacial in part because most of the earliest Thunderbolt peripherals were really aimed at the very high end market with big RAID or JBOD stations, and partly due to what boiled down to Thunderbolt being Apple-only until just recently.
Thereâ€™s an interesting story as to exactly why most of the initial Thunderbolt peripherals were aimed at such a high-end market, and some of it was purely because of both the TDP, size, and engineering constraints involved with the first generation Thunderbolt controllers. The other half of the equation is that selling external storage isnâ€™t always the most valuable prospect, as shoppers expect commodity pricing and generally know the cost of the drive inside. Thankfully, second generation Thunderbolt controllers with smaller size, TDP, and lower cost are now the norm, and at the same time Apple has unleashed more Macs with the interface of note, meaning that thereâ€™s a bigger captive market of potentially interested shoppers.
So when Buffalo dropped us a line about an upcoming 2.5"" form factor portable hard drive with both USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt interfaces, I couldnâ€™t resist the temptation and jumped at the opportunity to review it. When it comes to single drive external Thunderbolt storage, the only real options at this point are either the Seagate GoFlex, or the new Buffalo MiniStation Thunderbolt.
The Buffalo MiniStation comes in two flavors, differentiated only in storage size. Thereâ€™s a 1 TB version which runs $229.99 named the HD-PA1.0TU3, and a 500 GB version named the HD-PA500TU3 and priced at $199.99. The only difference is what drive you get inside; both include Thunderbolt and USB 3.0. Buffalo has also opted to include both the USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt cables with both MiniStations. Prior drives required the separate purchase of a Thunderbolt cable, which costs around $50. Since there are now multiple cable suppliers (whether this means the active controller in the cable, or companies cabling the system remains unknown to me), pricing has started creeping down and Buffalo was able to include both a 19.7 inch Thunderbolt cable and USB 3.0 cable.
|Buffalo MiniStation Thunderbolt|
|Storage||500 GB HDD||1 TB HDD|
|Interface||miniUSB 3.0 (2.0 legacy), Thunderbolt (no pass through), Cables Included|
|Size, Mass||3.17 x 5.12 x 0.91 (inches), 9.28 oz|
|Pricing||$199.99 (newegg)||$229.99 (newegg)|
Since Thunderbolt is still predominantly an Apple interface (7-series boards and IVB Ultrabooks notwithstanding), the industrial design of the Buffalo MiniStation is decidedly Apple inspired. The drive is made of two main parts, a single piece aluminum can in which the drive sits, and a plastic top which snaps inside this assembly.
Thereâ€™s a series of white status LEDs which shine through a diffuse rectangular chicklet cutout on the bottom front lip, which reflects up off of a surface. The indicator light breathes like an Apple power indicator when thereâ€™s activity, and stays solid when plugged in. Itâ€™s a nice take on an external hard disk status LED that I havenâ€™t seen done before.
On the underside are two small rubber feet which actually arenâ€™t part of the aluminum base but make contact with the drive caddy inside. Regulatory markings are laser etched near the front rubber foot. At the back of course are the Thunderbolt and USB 3.0 ports, on opposite sides of the drive.
Construction of the MiniStation is subjectively great. Thereâ€™s not much flex if you squeeze the aluminum side against the plastic lip, and it feels like a solid brick of aluminum in the hand. Iâ€™ve regularly transferred videos shot on my DSLR onto the MiniStation, then tossed the drive into the main pocket of my backpack. It isnâ€™t a super rugged design, but definitely will get the job done.",<urn:uuid:05a10dbc-fc89-4534-8522-0a3f61f86cf8>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://anandtech.com/Show/Index/6127?cPage=1&all=False&sort=0&page=1&slug=buffalo-ministation-thunderbolt-review-an-external-with-usb-30-and-thunderbolt,2013-05-18T06:44:13Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.930594862,990,,,,,

d God. If we have our mind in heaven like that, then we wonâ€™t be going down to the earth to these sinful passions. So, first of all, raising the mind to God in that way is a major help. Secondly, God does help. We pray to God, and itâ€™s not just the fact that weâ€™re turning our mind to him. Itâ€™s not just psychologically, but we are receiving Godâ€™s grace and help. There were other counsels he gave concerning avoiding over familiarity with people with whom you might be tempted to have a sinful relationship with. Just being constantly on guard in the spiritual life.,,,,,,,
Kevin: Father, you commented to me in your book. You mentioned that Eugene Rose had written in a letter some suicidal thoughts. Former Abbot Herman mentioned that he definitely had a death wish. What would you say to those who might comment that, because of his psychology, Fr. Seraphim represents a Christianity which somewhat overplays morbidity.,,,,,,,,,,
Fr. Damascene: We have to distinguish between the â€œoldâ€ Eugene Rose and the â€œrebornâ€ Eugene Rose and Fr. Seraphim. Fr. Seraphim was literally reborn when he entered the Orthodox Church. He wrote about this. He said that he had been reborn in the Lord and he had felt such joy that he had never known. All the goodness that was already in his nature just blossomed out and was multiplied by the grace of God which united with his soul. He became a new being. It was that old Eugene Rose that had those suicidal thoughts. As you mentioned, in one of Fr. Seraphimâ€™s letter, during a very dark period of his life before his conversion, he does mention having suicidal thoughts. He was in despair of not finding the truth. They said that he experienced the torments of hell even while he was alive. He had consciously turned away from God, because he had not found him in the religion in which he was raised. He was looking for something more, looking for that truth. He encountered that truth in Orthodoxy. When he became Orthodox, he became a new person. Of course he had no suicidal thoughts after he became Orthodox. Thereâ€™s no record of that, and I certainly would doubt it, knowing of his true rebirth in Christ and the Orthodox Church.,,,,,
But he had a healthy remembrance of death, as the Fathers talk about, and wanted to continue working. He felt that we had a limited time in order to do the work of God. He said, â€œItâ€™s later than you think; therefore, hasten to do the work of God.â€ He had that awareness. He had a limited number of years, and he wanted those years in order to come closer to God, to find God. He told Fr. Alexi young that if you donâ€™t find God in this life, you will not find him in the life to come. He wanted to draw closer to Christ and have that closer experience of Christ in the Churchâ€”the deeper experience of the Church. And an important part of his life was to bring that Orthodox faith and grace of the Church to others, to the non-Orthodox, to be a disseminator of grace. He wanted to bring the truth that he had discovered in the Orthodox Church and over which he had suffered so long to find. He wanted to give that truth to others, and that truth was Jesus Christ. He said that, when he became Orthodox, he understood that truth was a person. So he had that desire to live and bring forth fruit in the time God gave him. Therefore, I donâ€™t think he was morbid. He definitely had a healthy understanding of Christian struggle and the place of suffering in life. Maybe thatâ€™s what some people might consider morbid. He was a monk and just lived the life of a true monk. I donâ€™t think he was extreme.
Kevin: Which raises a question, as weâ€™re leaning toward the wrap up of this interview, and that is this: Since his work is so missionizing and evangelical in orientation, and since he was a discerner of the times and talked about topics which are so important in the modern world we live in (therefore, a lot of people will read them), do you think that there is a temptation perhaps, for those of us who are not monastics and who read the work of one whom youâ€™ve just described as being a maximalist, to perhaps confuse his vocation and calling as a monk with the normal or appropriate non-monastic life for those who are reading his work? Is there some way you can respond to that?,,,,,,
Fr. Damascene: Well, he did write his works for the non-monastics as well as the monastics. He wrote for the general readership and trying to reach out to everyone. He wrote a lot about putting the monastic texts of the Orthodox Church in their proper context, according to oneâ€™s own spiritual state. He said that we should not, either as monks or lay people, be proud and think that we can apply some very lofty teachings in the line of Divine Ascent or the Philokalia to our own spiritual state as if we are on the level of a saint. We have to realize that weâ€™re starting our spiritual life at the lowest step, whether weâ€™re monks or lay people. We have to have a down-to-earth, realistic understanding of our own low spiritual state, and the low spiritual state of our times. As I mentioned before, he said we have to understand that we come out of the self-worshiping, pampered generation. So, I think his writings are applicable to everyone, because he meant them to be that way, and he has many warnings in his writings against misapplying spiritual texts to oneâ€™s spiritual condition.,
Kevin: So he didnâ€™t expect obviously everybody who would read his works to come to the wilderness and live in a ten by fifteen foot, rustic cell.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fr. Damascene: Absolutely not. He would not expect that. His constant teaching was that we are to apply the teachings of the Church, the writings of the Fathers and the monastic saints, etc. to our own condition.,,,,,,,,,,,
Kevin: Father, as we wrap up, I have one final question, and itâ€™s a tough one because itâ€™s so broad. What in your opinion about Fr. Seraphimâ€™s life and writing has inspired and fascinated so many people all over the world. You mentioned Russia. They may have read more about him than people in the States. What is it about his life and his work?,,,,,,,,,,
Fr. Damascene: There are many aspects and many things that can be said about that. First of all, he was a discerner of the times. He understood the modern times very deeply, and he also understood the Orthodox faith very deeply. So he was able to cut through the deceptions of the times and give the Orthodox teaching, the teaching of the Fathers, straight. When you go to Fr. Seraphim, you find the pure teaching of the Fathers, the pure water of grace that come from those writings. Itâ€™s not distorted or twisted or artificially molded to conform to the modern mentality. You find a basic honesty in his writings, which I think is very refreshing for many people. Some people can kind of fudge a little bit. If thereâ€™s a teaching of the Church thatâ€™s a little bit too hard for our self-worshiping, pampered generation to take, they can kind of fudge a little bit, kind of soften it around the edges. Fr. Seraphim didnâ€™t do that. I think some people get turned off by that and have a hard time with it. But there are many people who want that. I really appreciate that.,,,
I should say, also, Fr. Seraphim can be very hard-hitting in his writings, because he was writing for everybody and this was going out to the world. He didnâ€™t want to compromise or sugarcoat anything. But pastorally, when he was dealing with people on a one-to-one basis, he was different. You see that in his letters. Therefore, youâ€™re dealing with a soul, and the soul has these various burdens and obstacles. He understood as a pastor that you have to reach out to a person where there are and not expect too much. As Christ said you donâ€™t want to put new wine into old bottles. So he was very careful with that. For example, when he talked with people who were involved in Eastern religions, he would take a different tone than when he was writing about Orthodoxy and the religion of the future. When he was writing to people coming out of a Charismatic background, he would be different.,,,
Kevin: Thatâ€™s an important nuance of reading him, that as a pastor he was applying that warm-heartedness and love, whereas here had to deal with a movement or large issue of the times. It might come across a little on the strong side or the hard-hitting side. Father Damascene, again," thank you very much for this wonderful interview. Itâ€™s very much appreciated.""",<urn:uuid:30e5f942-2f29-4ba9-8952-d80600febe50>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://ancientfaith.com/podcasts/illuminedheart/fr_seraphim_rose_the_man_the_struggler/print,2013-05-18T05:29:21Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.98776418,9709,
"Mindwave sat on the bunk of his dark cell quietly. Inside he smiled. He rubbed the back of his newly trimmed hair and over his clean shaven face.

He could see the smug look on Liberty's face. Mindwave smiled to himself at all the times he had thought of killing Liberty. What a waste.
He wouldn't kill Liberty, he'd ruin him. He'd take away everything Liberty had ever loved. He'd make Liberty desperate. Desperate people did stupid things. In the end he would let Liberty unravel his own life. Mindwave leaned against the wall and lifted his butt up and pulled his release papers out from under his bed.

"This is the approximate sound made on board a US submarine as it rises toward the surface, or engaged in a full dive. Iâ€™ve made few appearances lately, either here or in person at a lot of events, and I wanted to say a little bit about what Iâ€™ve been up to.
Iâ€™ve been changing things over at the Boy Scouts. Shaking them up a bit, maybe. Getting shook up, a lot. Iâ€™ve given them a lot more of my time this summer than I meant to, and itâ€™s taken its toll. The chapel service this week was the best weâ€™ve had all summer, but it was also the least well-attended; I find myself wondering if word is getting around that Iâ€™m not doing a specifically Christian service, or worse. I learned half-a-dozen new plants in the first two weeks of camp, but since then itâ€™s been nothing. I taught one group of boy scouts to recognize a couple of edible wild plants â€” so they harvested all of them and brought them to their troop to sample. Now theyâ€™re gone from camp, despite my warnings that they should not harvest ALL of them.
These are the same people who get angry at me for balancing rocks. Itâ€™s not OK to balance rocks in public places within sight of a man-made lake, but it is OK to harvest every single sample of an edible wild species despite an instructorâ€™s warnings to the contrary??
Last summer, the food was terrible and I lost weight. The new cook is good, but for all the walking and exercise Iâ€™ve been getting, Iâ€™ve not been losing weight, Iâ€™ve been gaining.
A week from Saturday, and Iâ€™ll be on a plane to Colorado Springs, CO, for ten days of USFA coachesâ€™ college. You can tell me who to see and what poetry events to check out in Colorado Springs, but frankly, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to have the time.
I have a new writing assignment from folks down in GA. Havenâ€™t seen a contract, donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m supposed to get paid â€” tempted to pass on the contract for an August in the cockpit of my kayak.
Still havenâ€™t finished the July New Moon sonnet, and a couple of other poems, and feeling really ticked off about that. Getting hints from school that in the wake of a colleagueâ€™s departure, that thereâ€™s all sorts of new work for me to do, and not much in the way of compensation or recognition â€” need to be better about saying, â€œthis doesnâ€™t work for me.â€
A lot doesnâ€™t seem to be working for me.

USB Tether Through VZAccess Not Working
Hello, I have mentioned this in the XDA thread, but i figured i would include it here as well.
I am having issues using the verizon usb tether plan with my phone after putting virtuous on it. What i have done so far, is installed 3.0.1 after a wipe, via rom manager. when i connect my phone to my pc (i have tried 3 different computers with the same results) and select mobile broadband as the option, some interesting things happen, first my computer makes sounds indicating usb has been unplugged and replugged, and i wait for the hardware to be recognized, which it appears to be with no error. BUT the HTC modem HW never shows up. VZAccess manager, tells me it cant find my phone.
if i look on the phone in wireless & networks, mobile network is checked, but mobile Broad Band connect is not. if i manually check/uncheck these boxes in any order, it still does not work.
if i flash my phone back via clockwork, to my stock 2.1 just after root. and plug my phone in, i select broadband, and the hw appears in device manager, and vz access sees it, and connects online immediately.
i was asked at xda what antenna i am running 2.15.00.07.28. Any suggestions or help you can provide would be great. I really like the Virtuous rom, just dont like not being able to usb tether for work.",<urn:uuid:9ed96b84-65c9-4717-b06a-3ee923a15d8f>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://androidforums.com/virtuous/190330-usb-tether-through-vzaccess-not-working.html,2013-05-18T05:26:01Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.940116465,353,,,,,
"Last week AllThingsD broke the story that Google was hiring most of the team from Milk, a startup founded by Kevin Rose that was working on iPhone apps. Milkâ€™s first project was an app called Oink that let users rate items, but that service was shut down last week, likely because of the talks with Google.
We still donâ€™t know Kevinâ€™s exact role on the Android team, but Matt Lynley of Business Insider thinks he will be helping with design. They learned that Google only hired the product team from Milk, while the engineers on the team were not offered jobs. Former Milk employee Amber Reyngoudt told Business Insider that Google was â€œlooking to add design talent.â€
I never had the chance to play with Oink, but some people described it as â€œeasily one of the best-looking apps on the iPhone.â€ Check out the YouTube trailer below to get a feel of what it looked like.
We have been pretty happy with the latest changes in Androidâ€™s look, since Google hired Matias Duarte as Senior Director of Android User Experience. However, itâ€™s still easy to point out some native Google apps that need updating, so maybe the Milk team can help with that.
What parts of Android do you think need design help?
Update: Google employee Dan Morrill confirms that Kevin Rose is working on Google+. It appears Business Insider read too much into their conversations with former Milk employees.",<urn:uuid:5a2292e2-c042-47a4-b260-39c6bded8a9f>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://androidtabletupdate.com/tag/milk/,2013-05-18T05:23:26Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.974532187,304,,,,,

- Written Assignments: There will be two argumentative
and analytical papers, the first of eight to ten pages, the
second either a new paper of eight to ten pages, or
an expansion of your first paper to fifteen to twenty
- Annotated Bibliographies: Each student will prepare an
annotated bibliography on one day's reading or another apropos
critical or historical topic.
- In-Class Reports: You'll be expected to give a brief
presentation on the reading the same day you present your
annotated bibliography. Details are below.
Virtually all the readings will be available on-line on the World
Wide Web; copies of most pieces will also be available on reserve

Reports and Annotated Bibliographies
Each student will be particularly responsible for the readings on
one day of the semester, producing and distributing (on paper or
by E-mail) a short annotated bibliography of relevant criticism
and then beginning class with an oral report of between ten and
fifteen minutes. The report should begin with a very brief
discussion of the annotated bibliography the student has
prepared, giving a quick overview of the major scholarship on the
topic. Thereafter, the topic is anything relevant to the day's
reading material. A good report will raise as many fruitful
questions as possible and get discussion rolling. Anything
that will help -- handouts, short readings for the rest of the
class -- is welcome and encouraged.

"So, it seems I really like working with Input Methods.
This time I present you the Qt4 input context plugin for Hildon Input Method. So for now all Qt4 applications can make use of the maemo keyboard.
The code is still in its initial stage, but it's working so far. You can grab it from here.
Contributions are really welcome. If you want to help, please consider looking at the FIXME list on qhildoninputcontext.cpp :).

Not wanting to blow my own trumpet but the best bit on this ubber cool film from Al Lee is mine and Ianâ€™s Patagonia Winter instalment, due primarily to the fact thereâ€™s no climbing on it!
I think Al is one of the most talented climbing film makers, and in Patagonia winter this highlighted as he takes hours of footage where nothing happens, a minute when something does*, and a bunch of great photos, and produces what Yvon Chuinard described as one of the best climbing films ever.
Patagonia winter stands out as a testament to Alâ€™s skill as a film maker, and the simple humour of two climbers on the edge of a nervous breakdown",<urn:uuid:6ddd2340-f826-456f-9eb8-20122eaaafbe>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://andy-kirkpatrick.com/shop/product/psyche,2013-05-18T06:25:38Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.876550257,714,,,,,

"Below, I essentially replicate his results with the purpose of trying to reproduce them in a way that is a little easier for mere mortals like myself to digest. Instead of showing the entire distribution, I use mean values for each group. Razib concludes:
The general qualitative result: American conservative Protestants are in the main to the center or social liberal end of Muslim public opinion. They are not comparable at all to Muslim reactionaries.As the averages make clearer, conservative Protestants (defined here as those who expressed a preference for the Republican party) are in fact more liberal on each of these issues than Muslims in any of the countries included are. Keep in mind, the comparison here is between conservative Protestants and all Muslims, not just between evangelicals and reactionary Islamists. The latter comparison would show conservative Protestants to be even more liberal relative to Muslims than this comparison does.
Finally, using standard deviation values reported in the WVS, each of the tables also shows where the average conservative Protestant fits into the Muslim distribution*. So, on the question of the justifiability of homosexuality, the average conservative American Protestant is at 71st percentile of the Muslim population. Because the wife-beating question is inverted, the figure shows where the average conservative Protestant falls on the another-black-eye-to-explain-to-the-neighbors-is-unjustifiable distribution. The higher the value (on a 1-10 scale), the more justifiable the act or behavior in question is viewed as being:
|Conservative Protestants (US)||3.2|
|Conservative Protestant percentile among Muslims||71st percentile|
|Conservative Protestants (US)||3.5|
|Conservative Protestant percentile among Muslims||73rd percentile|
|Man to beat his wife||Score|
|Conservative Protestants (US)||1.3|
|Conservative Protestant percentile among Muslims||63rd percentile|
WVS variables used: V185, V231(Republican), V202, V204, V208
* Arrived at by simply averaging the averages of each of the Muslim groups on each question. This skews Muslim opinion towards that of the Middle East and North Africa and away from South Asia, which, in terms of sheer numbers, is unrepresentative of the world's roughly 1.6 billion Muslims. Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh all have far more Muslims than any of the MENA countries do, but with the exception of Pakistan, when Americans think of Muslims, they primarily have Arabs and Persians in mind.",<urn:uuid:72d93b86-e729-4691-baf5-73415c854495>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://anepigone.blogspot.com/2012/05/religious-conservatives-in-us-more.html?showComment=1336500736575,2013-05-18T07:19:36Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.893719494,515,,,,,

"This is not an attack.
This is a response.
I woke up at 4 oâ€™clock in the morning thinking about you, Geraldine.
I lay there listening to my sorta-beagles snore and wondered if you really think that Senator Obama is still in this race solely because he is a black man.
I donâ€™t know you, Geraldine, and I donâ€™t assume a person is decent simply because they hold a certain status in the Democratic Party and feminist history. This bitch has never met you, but I sure as shit know what it is like to have someone attribute my success to my being black.
Itâ€™s the freakiest mind fuck out there to have someone treat what has been the source of oppression like it is the â€œitâ€ benefit of 2008.
But you know that, donâ€™t youâ€¦Geraldine?
And it is a sadly powerful attack that dismisses all the hard work; the years spent biting your tongue, the ass whoopings you chose to hold back and the cussing outs that never happened even though not telling someone about themselves almost caused you physical pain.
""If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position,"" Ferraro said. ""And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept.""
Which I translate to mean that you, Geraldine, think Alan Keyes just had bad timing.
Letâ€™s get real, Geraldine. You donâ€™t give a flying shit whether you offend the hell out of some people as long as your message gets through to the right people. The kind of people who hear a quote like that and are thankful that someone said itâ€¦fucking cheer when they hear it then eagerly e-mail it to five friendsâ€¦and canâ€™t believe youâ€™re catching hell for it.
â€¦who you need to fire up and are confident the tried and true fuel of 'gender trumps race' will get it done and bring in some money.
This trifling ass shit has left me unable to imagine a scenario where I cast the vote people risked their lives and died to achieve for me for a candidate who's campaign insults what I stand for and the principles I believe in.
This has been so fucking not nice.
And next time donâ€™t bother with the â€œand if he was a woman (of any color)â€ pander, okay?
I havenâ€™t been caught up in that unified sisterhood concept yet, honey...and your verbal malfunction didnâ€™t help with that shit one bit.
Iâ€™m not attacking you because you are white.
This is coming at you because youâ€™re wrongâ€¦",<urn:uuid:f70b6969-82c9-4770-a33f-9dbec7dd5fa4>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://angryblackbitch.blogspot.com/2008/03/dear-geraldine.html?showComment=1205339460000,2013-05-18T08:08:48Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.956721663,596,,,,,
"Practicing the Fine Art of Bitchitude

guess that makes me a psychopath because i only comb mine on good days :) i watched 1600 pennsylvania ave. on msnbc last night- for about 20 minutes. in that time, david shuster tried his darnedest to interview 2 psychiatrists and convince them that rod was crazy. they weren't buying and i don't either. he's a politician who has had no accountability- and since we have had an entire federal government like that for at least the past 8 years, does that make all of them certifiable? no- it just makes them criminal. instead of trying to make him crazy (or any of the rest) how about we start prosecuting? gah!

"Octodon degus is generally considered endemic to west central Chile, where it inhabits the lower slopes of the Andes. Although some have argued that its range may extend north into Peru, this is not well supported. It is common in the international pet trade, however, and is often used in laboratory studies outside of its native range. (Contreras, et al., 1987; Woods and Boraker, 1975)
Octodon degus inhabits a mediterranean-type semi-arid shrubland ecosystem called ""matorral"", which is found on the western slopes of the Andes between 28 and 35 degrees south latitude. Further north the climate becomes too arid to support this plant community, and further south it is too wet. Degus appear to be limited to elevations below 1200 meters, both by the distribution of their habitat and by their intolerance of low oxygen partial pressure. Degus are well able to inhabit lands influenced by cattle grazing, and are agricultural pests in some areas. (Contreras, et al., 1987; Fulk, 1976)
Octodon degus superficially resembles a gerbil, but is much larger. Degus typically weigh between 170 and 300 g, and measure between 325 and 440 mm in length, including the tail. The fur is yellow-brown on the back and head, and the underparts and feet are cream colored. There is a pale band around the eye and, in some individuals, the neck. The tail is moderately long and conspicuously tufted. The ears are large and darkly pigmented. The fifth digit is reduced, and on the forefeet it has a nail instead of a claw. The cheekteeth are hypsodont and their biting surfaces resemble a figure of eight. Sexes are difficult to distinguish, but males tend to be about 10% larger than females. Pups are born furred and able to see, and begin exploring within hours of birth. Octodon degus can be distinguished from the two other members of the genus Octodon by slight differences in dental morphology. It is also smaller than its relatives and its tail is said to be more noticeably tufted. (Fulk, 1976; Lee, 2004)
During the annual breeding season, male-male aggression temporarily increases. Males exclude other males from their burrow and monopolize the females (usually 2 to 4) who live there. Dustbathing and urine marking may be used in the defense of territory by both sexes, but these behaviors particularly increase in the male during the breeding season. Courting males often engage in mutual grooming with females, and frequently perform a courtship ritual which involves wagging of the tail and trembling of the body. The male then raises a hind leg and sprays urine onto the female. This may serve to familiarize her with his scent and perhaps make her more receptive to his advances in the future. Receptive females may sometimes enurinate males in a similar fashion. Related female degus may nurse each other's young. (Ebensperger and Caiozzi, 2002; Fulk, 1976; Kleiman, 1974; Soto-Gamboa, 2005)
In the wild degus tend to breed once per year. The breeding season usually begins in late May (autumn in Chile), and the young are conceived in late winter to early spring (September to October). In wet years, degus may produce second litters. It has been suggested that degus may be induced ovulators, but this has not been established for certain. There is also some evidence that male reproductive organs may be sensitive to changes in photoperiod. The gestation period is 90 days, and litter size is typically 4-6 pups. The young are precocial. They are born with fur and teeth; their eyes are open and they are able to move about the nest on their own. Pups are weaned at 4 to 5 weeks, and become sexually mature between 12 and 16 weeks of age. Degus do not reach adult size until about 6 months of age, however, and they generally live in same-sex social groups until they are about 9 months old and their first breeding season occurs. It has been reported that pups raised in isolation in the laboratory experience severe neural and behavioral abnormalities. (Ebensperger and Hurtado, 2005; Lee, 2004; Woods and Boraker, 1975)
Before conception can occur, the male degu must invest considerable energy in the defense of his territory and harem from other males. The female subsequently expends considerable energy in gestation and lactation. The pregnancy is relatively long for a rodent, and the young are born well developed. After birth, both parents protect and provision the pups. Degus nest communally, and groups of related females nurse one another's young. In the laboratory, the female remains close to the pups until two weeks after birth, and males have been observed to huddle with the young during this period without instances of infanticide. In the wild, male degus may spend as much time feeding and huddling with the young as females do. Pups begin to eat solid food at about two weeks of age, and venture out of the burrow at three weeks. Upon weaning at four to six weeks, the pups are able to live independently of the parents and form same-sex social groups until their first breeding season. (Ebensperger and Hurtado, 2005; Fulk, 1976; Lee, 2004; Woods and Boraker, 1975)
In laboratory conditions, degus typically live five to eight years.
Degus are social and tend to live in groups of one to two males and two to five related females. Females participate in rearing on another's young. Groups maintain territories throughout much of the year. Degus are semi-fossorial, digging extensive communal burrow systems. These burrows are often shared by Bennett's chinchilla rat (Abrocoma bennettii). Degus feed exclusively above ground, however, and have been observed climbing into the low branches of shrubs while foraging. Dustbathing is an important social behavior among degus. Groups repeatedly mark favorite wallows with urine and anal gland secretions. This may help the group identify each other by scent as well as delineating territorial boundaries. Degus are mainly diurnal, and are most active during the morning and evening. (Ebensperger, et al., 2004; Fulk, 1976; Woods and Boraker, 1975)
Fulk (1976) estimated that social groups of degus occupy home areas of roughly 200 square meters, and that their density is about 75 degus per hectare. This may be an underestimate, however, due to the trapping methods used. (Fulk, 1976)
Degus have well-developed sight, smell, and hearing. They are highly vocal and use various calls to communicate with one another, including alarm calls, mating calls, and communication between parents and young. Vision is very important in avoidance of predators and in foraging. It has been shown that degus are able to see ultraviolet wavelengths, and that their urine reflects in the UV range when fresh. It has therefore been suggested that degus' urine scent marks are also visual cues. These scent marks are also used as dust wallows, allowing members of a social group to identify each other by scent. (Chavez, et al., 2003; Fulk, 1976; Woods and Boraker, 1975)
Degus are generalist herbivores. They feed on the leaves, bark, and seeds of shrubs and forbs. Among their favorite foods are the bark of Cestrum palqui and Mimosa cavenia, leaves and bark of Proustia cuneifolia, Atriplex repunda, and Acacia caven, annuals such as Erodium cicutarum when in season, green grasses, and thistle seeds. Degus choose food items that reduce fiber and increase nitrogen and moisture in the diet, and thus prefer young leaves and avoid woodier shrubs. Degus rely on microbial fermentation in their enlarged cecum (they are ""hindgut fermenters"") to digest their food. They reingest a large percentage of their feces, usually during the night. This allows them to maximize their digestion. Degus store food in the winter, and it has been reported that they occasionally eat meat in old age. (Gutierrez and Bozinovic, 1998; Kenagy, et al., 1999; Veloso and Kenagy, 2005; Woods and Boraker, 1975)
Octodon degus is subject to predation by larger mammals such as culpeo foxes (Lycalopex culpaeus), and from the air by raptors such as barn owls (Tyto alba), short-eared owls (Asio flammeus), and black-chested buzzard eagles (Geranoaetus melanoleucus). Degus use vigilance and cover to avoid predators. Their pelage is also counter-shaded and matches the soil color, which reduces visibility to predators. Degus live socially and use alarm calls to warn others of danger. When a predator is spotted, they take cover in shrubby areas and may retreat to the communal burrow. (Ebensperger and Wallem, 2002; Woods and Boraker, 1975)
Octodon degus affects the plant community in its habitat by selective browsing. Degus behaviorally reduce the fiber content of their diet, preferrentially eating shrubs such as Adesmia bedwellii, Baccharis paniculata, and Chenopodium petioare, which are less fibrous and less thorny than others. These species have been shown to increase their foliage area upon exclusion of degus. As degus are very common, they are themselves an important food source for their predators. (Gutierrez and Bozinovic, 1998)
Degus often live in association with Bennett's chinchilla rats (Abrocoma bennettii). The two species are known to share burrow systems and have even been observed in the same chamber within a burrow. This is believed to be a mutualistic relationship, but it is not well understood. (Fulk, 1976; Woods and Boraker, 1975)
Degus are frequently kept as pets, and are used extensively in laboratory research. Because they are largely diurnal, they are useful in research on circadian rhythms, and their intolerance of sugars makes them ideal models for diabetes research. (Lee, 2004)
Degus are significant agricultural pests in some areas. They take advantage of cultivated prickly pear cactus, wheat, vineyards, and orchards as abundant food sources, and can do considerable damage. They are also known to host three species of parasites that can infect humans. (Fulk, 1976)

"The first day of spring was a couple of days ago, and I for one am glad to see it - except that I can already tell the pollen is starting to come out. I'm like a human barometer for that every year. :-)
I'm sorry I have not posted much here over the last few weeks. I've been incredibly busy with regular store business. For folks that blog several times a week, or even several times a day, my question is - how the heck do you guys have the time? I always think of Glen Reynolds over at Instapundit. He posts maybe 10-20 times a day all day long, and I figure whatever else he does, his entire life must revolve around his blog. When he's not blogging, he's thinking about blogging, or looking for things to blog about, or conversing with people that write in about the blog. I seem to always have something else to do that needs to be done NOW. Anyway, my goal here is going to be to post at least once a week, so we'll see how that turns out.
It has been another exciting week here at Anime Corner world headquarters, and I have several items to share with you:
Ergo Proxy 3 arrived on Friday - we had it air freighted in from Geneon so we could start shipping orders as early as possible. We're shipping it now and all of your pre-orders were filled by close of business on Friday March 23rd. Oh yeah, all of our copies of Ergo 3 in this shipment have the limited pencil board - we'll be shipping those first until they run out.
I spend a lot of my time here on 'logistics' - you know, figuring out where and when and how stuffis coming, and there certainly has been a lot of activity in that dept this week. We got a slew of new solicitations over that last couple of weeks for June and July titles and we'll have them all up on the site shortly. A couple of the new titles include Galaxy Angel AA and MAR which are already posted. Also, Geneon will be re-releasing Ikki Tousen in a Thin-Pak (same price, same bat channel) in June and won't be repressing the old box, so it will probably be unavailable for a short time until the new boxes come out. Finally, we now have the last volume of Inu Yasha up for pre-order - volume #55! Wow - 4 years to get a series released, it reminds me if Urusei Yatsura or DBZ. Now when are the rest of those IY boxed sets coming??.... -_^
We have a couple more date changes this week - in fact there have been so many lately they are getting hard to keep up with. Tactics 4 was pushed from 3-20 to 3-27, but became moot as it has already arrived. The new company Illumitoon pushed the BoBoBoBo 2 DVD from 4-6 to 5-1. They also announced that the Beet 2 DVD and the BT'X 2 DVD have been pulled entirely from the release schedule and will be re-announced at a later date. Since these titles have sold moderately well, one can only speculate at this point as to what their plans are, but we'll keep on top of things and let you know. Geneon cancelled the Paradise Kiss 3 Special Edition DVD, but the regular edition is still set to street on April 17th.
I know I've done a lot of talking about the upcoming Melancholy limited edition boxes. Sam, the product manager at Bandai, told me this week that they are producing exactly 20,000 boxed sets for the North American release, and they were surprised by the massive amount of retailer pre-orders for them that have already been placed. The boxes are made overseas and the order has been placed by Bandai, so Sam says quote ""once they are gone there is no more - period"". I can almost guarantee you that this box is now, or almost is, sold out in pre-release and will be allocated to retailers by Bandai. Sam said that retailers who order early will be more likely to get the product that they ordered. That's good news as we got our order in on the first day, so our units are right at the front of the line and we will be able to guarantee delivery of boxes up to about the first 500 pre-ordered (we're 82% of the way there now as of 3/23), and I will probably close the pre-order window once we hit the 500 mark.
We have posted quite a few new announcements for pre-order, some of the more notable include Wings of Rean, the 4th Naruto Uncut Box, the 2nd Prince of Tennis Box, the 2nd Ranma 1/2 Thin-Pak, and the first Freedom DVD (HDDVD/DVD) which will be the very first HD-DVD Anime release here in North America. I was wondering when that was going to happen. :-)
A lot of people have been asking us recently what we plan to do about the postal rate increase coming next month. Admittedly shipping charges have been a point of consternation for us as we try to offer you a great deal of choices, excellent delivery time and quality, and still offer shipping at a reasonable price. We have not increased our shipping prices in 3 years even though all of the carriers have increased their rates to us several times during this period. As shipping has become the 'condiment' of the internet shopping world (you know, serve a lower quality hot-dog but give the mustard away for free), it's become very challenging for us to try to put together a new shipping program that covers our actual freight costs but that fits the requirements of all of your diverse needs. We are currently working on a new shipping program that is similar to what we offer now, with our usual diverse selection or types, carriers, and quality of delivery, but that will also offer more choices for budget minded customers. We'll be integrating the new program into the new order checkout manager, and we would greatly appreciate any input on this subject that you guys have for us. Your comments help us better tailor our program to fit your specific needs, and that's what it's all about.
After many requests, we've expanded our trade in program to include video games, even really old ones. Check our trade in FAQ for details.
I have two great sales for you this week, one is a newsletter exclusive set of coupons that you canuse across the store, and the other is a nice set of overstocked figure discounts (up to 35% off) that we need to move out to make room for new arrivals. Newsletter subscribers can combine the two offers to save even more! See below for all the info.

Or to save 5% off any order over $150, use the following coupon code during checkout:
Coupons are valid ONLY for NEW orders, and are good through Thursday, March 29th only.

We have some great new stuff for this week in just about every category from DVD's to Manga to Figures to Statues, and even some cool new character merchandise including new scrolls and a couple of rare Anime themed bath towels that arrived from Japan. Be sure to take a look at the excellent new Sana Horiuchi figure from Pia Carrot and the very large Tamaki Kousaka from To Heart as they are two of my favorites. Also, we have a few of both of the new Tandem Twins girls left over after filling your pre-orders - including the much sought after 'option' parts that bring the figures, well, to their full potential. :-)
Finally, we received a special shipment of art books that I was able to coax away from one of our vendors in Tokyo. Many of these gorgeous art books have been out of print for more than 5 years and since they are extremely rare we might only have as little as 2 or 3 copies of each.
This little shipment was a long time in the making, and I hope we are able to help you fill some of the holes in your collection. I know it certainly helped mine. :-)",<urn:uuid:ba7abe35-1add-44d8-89d4-dc880bf01545>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://animecornerstore.blogspot.com/2007_03_01_archive.html,2013-05-18T07:13:21Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.979278624,1712,,,,,

***Photo by Elliot Cowan. Left to right: me, Linda Beck, and Tim Rauch. Deeper in the background are Willy Hartland and Ray Kosarin. From drinks after the ASIFA event.
ASIFA-East's Linda Beck just put together a panel on the State of NY Animation, and you can read Katie Cropper's tidy summary of it at the ASIFA-East exposure sheet blog at www.asifaeast.com. The panel discussion was moderated by Linda Beck and featured Howard Beckerman, David Wachtenheim, Steve Connor, and myself.
Howard Beckerman was his usual charming self and to record all his wisdom here would be impossible. I will say that he was a calming voice of reason, giving us example after example of how this has all happened before. He also shared some of his strategies for surviving in this fickle industry, reminding that when one door closed another always opened. In other words, when theatrical cartoons dwindled TV commercials appeared to pick up the slack.
Steve Connor pragmatically suggested that everyone devote their efforts to making solid work on schedule and on budget and how that alone can help keep projects flowing in the Big Apple. He also suggested that even independent projects could be planned out with a better process that could be applied to making the same project with a larger crew should the project grow to a series.
David Wachtenheim (of Wachtenheim/Marianetti) eloquently spoke of shrinking budgets and less commercial work floating around these days. He worried about the perception of clients, that there's a kid in his living room somewhere that can do the work cheaper and at a ""good enough"" quality.
After the panel, fifty of us headed over to grab drinks at a nearby bar. While I was munching on a burger, Katie Cropper and I were discussing the evening. She told me that my message of ""make things happen, make your own luck, and work on your own projects,"" suited my personality. ""It's natural for you to do that,"" she said. And, this made me wonder just how much personality weighs in to a career. Although I would caution that what one does well often appears to others as if its effortless or simply natural.
No two of us are hard wired the same way. And, I think too many of us are at the mercy of our own harmful thinking. At the panel, I explained that I don't give much thought to what is going on in the economy and how it might effect NY animation. Instead, I am aware (as Howard Beckerman kept pointing out) that NY animation has always had its ups and downs. My focus is to only worry about what I can control. Therefore, I make films, I pitch shows and children's books. I look out for interesting work opportunities and am careful to nurture relationships that often lead to more work.
During the panel, I told the audience that I tried to follow a smart plan as an at-home freelancer. In my current pair of freelance gigs for Sesame Workshop, I am sure to check in with the client on a regular basis to give them updates on the status of the work. Recently, they had an internal meeting to change the creative direction on one of the jobs. The producer gave me the choice of coming in for the meeting or just getting an update afterwards. For me, there was no choice. Of course I wanted to be at the meeting! Not only would attending the meeting allow me to get on the same creative page with the group, but it would also be a chance to meet with another set of folks from Sesame Workshop. I want to be more than just an anonymous freelancer uploading and downloading work. I understand that relationships are important to getting future work.
How much of this is based on personality and how much of this is just ol' fashioned common sense? I think it weighs heavier towards common sense. As if to provide the opposite to my story above, I heard of another animation artist who scuttled his working relationship with a new client after he came in for a meeting and then decided to bill them for it. This instantly caused a squabble and this artist was told that if he kept the charge for the meeting on his bill, they would pay it, but would not work with him again. The artist chose to be paid and kissed the relationship goodbye. Subsequently another artist got the job and worked on that particular project for almost a whole year. The industry will have its up and downs, but the greatest risk we face is making our own personal droughts.
Each of us IS different, but better sense can be adapted by all. Personality helps and hurts in different turns and factors in to what jobs are the right and wrong fits for us. For one of my long-term flash series directing jobs, I later found out that the producers also interviewed another experienced director who had several flash series to his name, while I had none. The producers told me that they didn't hire him because he was too much of a football coach personality, while I was mellow and non-threatening. My personality helped me win that day, but this ""football coach"" director has continued on with his own great career. Clearly, he's a great fit for many employers, football coach-style and all.
Good sense and sound judgment can be learned, but only if a person is open to learning from their own mistakes. A closed off person with an old-school ""the producers or client is always out to screw me"" attitude is not going to get far. And if they do get far, they will have had to be the most talented person in the room. That's not an option available to me, so I've always pushed other skills, learned other lessons, and kept applying them forward. The mistakes I've made can fill a book (actually, three!), which only proves that mistakes don't have to be career-killers, unless we decide that they are.
Furthermore at the panel discussion, some wondered what will happen as India and South Korea (and others) gear up to build strong animation industries. ""They're going to take our jobs,"" many worried. I say, that's only possible if there's such a thing as ""our jobs."" I argue that there is NOT. There are no agreed upon jobs that are ours for the taking or that can be reserved for us like a rental car. Not on an individual level, nor a city-wide level, nor a national level. We have to reach out for those jobs...to create them ourselves. There's no such thing as entitlement. Just because we decided to be journeymen animation artists doesn't mean the industry owes us squat. This can be empowering if you let it. That's how I think. Who can say I'm wrong? It's my view of the universe and it holds true in my own head, and it helps me survive and navigate this difficult industry.
Some in the audience bemoaned NYC animation as primarily a preschool animation city. And, while many of the series have been preschool shows, there have also been older kids shows made here such as Sheep in the Big City, Codename: Kids Next Door, Kappa Mikey, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Doug, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. There has also been a batch of ""adult"" or animation for tweens in the form of Beavis and Butthead, The Head, Celebrity Death Match, Daria, Downtown, Fridays, The Venture Bros., Super Jail, Assy McGee, Gary the Rat, and This Just In. This city is what we make it. If your goal is to make animation for a different audience, then the ball is in your court. If you succeed, it may not change the perception of NY animation over night, but it will be a step in a different direction. Everything is a first until it isn't. Feature animation was not a reality in this country until Disney made it happen. No British rock band had ever broken through to the American market until The Beatles. The first one through the door has a tendency to leave the door open for what comes next.
Don't get me wrong, I don't have solid plans myself. I never have. I don't assume to know what I will be able to accomplish. I have assorted goals, but none of them have expiration dates on them. So, the only direction I have in my career is that I am going after my goals. Each day I work towards achieving them. And, I don't look at external obstacles as my problem. In my own head, the state of NY Animation is a perpetually a green traffic light.

Why have I stayed in NY... instead of ""heading west young man?"" It's an interesting question to ponder, although its rare that I think about this. I never set out to be a booster of the NY animation scene. I was born here. My dad earned a terrific living as top Advertising Art director and executive (at one point he was even a vice president at Benton & Bowles), so I saw one could survive and thrive working in the commercial arts in the NY area. There was only one thing against me. No, it wasn't the anemic NY animation industry. It was my own underdeveloped talents. Spending four years at SVA didn't change that, and that was no fault to SVA. It was my own stubborn refusal to work hard enough to challenge myself. In fact, I didn't even know I had made that choice. But, choices are often made silently, aren't they?
When I was privileged with the opportunity to work at Michael Sporn's studio it was both at once a rarified experience as well as typical to New York animation. Rare in that Michael's studio (then and now) tackled animation from beginning to end. No outsourcing like much of the production at MTV, Jumbo, Curious, 4Kids, Scholastic, World Leaders, (and others that have since come and gone). Here was a place to learn it all from top to bottom, because of a supportive boss like Michael and the wonderful staff that followed his lead. I soon had the opportunity to try my hand at storyboards, designs, animation, writing...all within the two year period I worked at his studio.
While this would have indeed been rare to get this variety of experience at some NY studios in such a short amount of time, it WAS representative of a key an aspect of NY animation. Namely; flexibility. Getting to do different things on different projects. That's something I have never taken for granted. It still tickles me that I get to do that.
No, I'm not a character designer in the Phil Rynda sense (he is amazing, by the way.) Just check out http://philrynda.blogspot.com/
But, by being in NYC animation I get design opportunties just the same. I recently whipped out the above 3 designs after sesame workshop hired me to animate a 30 second spot. They wanted to see lots of different design approaches so I spent two or three days exploring some possible styles. They loved one particular design (not shown above) so much that they asked me to just animate that character as it was drawn. These fun little gigs, they seem very ""NYC animation"" to me. It's part of our blend of the independent and the commercial. Michael Sporn, his disciples, and those of the other NY botique-style animation studios (Buzzco, JJs, Asterisk, Wachtenheim and Marianetti, etc) are the true face of NY animation. They are the survivors that remain as the big studios come and go.
So, in NY animation we find ourselves with a happy problem. What to call oneself? Am I a director? A filmmaker? A designer? A writer? An author? A teacher? An animator? A jack of all trades but a master of none? To some, I'm simply the president of ASIFA-East. But, in NY animation, one doesn't have to choose one label. And, by some absurd turn of fate, this formerly raw SVA graduate is now paid to do all of these things (well, except the president of ASIFA-East thing). Why have I stayed in NY? Where else could one have such a career? And, best of all, I could list more than a hundred people just like me. Only chances are, they will be better designers.

I have been an adjunct teacher since 2003. That was the year that Richard O'Connor recommended me to Parsons School of Design to temporarily take over a class he was teaching. I was deep in my ""land of milk and honey"" Blue's Clue's job, which turned out to be almost 8 years of end-to-end employment. Back then, I wasn't hurting for money, and it would have been very easy to turn the teaching down. Most of my colleagues weren't teaching on the side. A small handful were. Teaching is something that had always been on my personal fear list and therefore it was something I had to do. If something is a new experience, it's probably something useful. In fact, animation producer Tina Moglia just told my career class that her only factor to stay on a job is, ""Am I learning anything?""
So, how do you get an opportunity to teach? First of all, work in the industry. Local schools such as Parsons, Pratt, SVA, and NYU don't require that an adjunct teacher have a Master's degree or even a Bachelor's degree. You only need to be a working professional and that includes most of us! The next thing to do is to be an active member of the animation community. Let others see you running events, making films, and volunteering for organization's like ASIFA-East. This will grow your profile and show that you are reliable and able to juggle multiple tasks. Thirdly, tell animation teachers you know that you're interested in teaching. Current teachers are often the first ones to hear about positions opening. Usually, current teachers get a crack at the first new opportunities, but not all of them are a good fit, and many times a teacher will be able to pass the lead on to their contacts. Lastly, you can also try to set up a meeting with the head of the school's animation department and present yourself as a potential teacher.
The interesting thing about teaching one class is that it tends to mushroom into several classes, perhaps even spread over different schools. Just six months after taking on my first class at Parsons, Machi Tantillo recommended that I take over her Animation Career class at SVA. It was the class that inadvertently launched me as an author when my class plan spun off for the book, Your Career in Animation: How to Survive and Thrive (Allworth Press). A couple of years later, John Canemaker brought me in as temporary teacher at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, at which I will return to teach a pair of classes this year. School's like to give multiple classes to teachers that are already proven commodities, which only makes sense. But, new teachers crack through every so often, so try to make yourself one of the success stories by following the plan above.
The income that my first class brought in (teaching one 15-week class pays about $3,000) wasn't something I needed in 2003. But, it sure helped me in 2004 when I returned to the freelance life for 10 months, and again in 2007 to the present day when I became a full-time at-home freelancer. Income-wise, teaching has become a life-line, a guaranteed check that I can count on. It represents the very least amount of money I can make in a tough year such as 2009. The other nice thing about teaching is how it flexible it can be. Many times, the teacher can suggest a day and time that works best for them. When possible, I try to do most of my teaching at 6 PM classes, and that way when I have a full time in-house job, the class won't interfere.
Most of all, I really appreciate the way teaching puts me into contact with the upcoming generations of animation artists. It's inspiring to see the work they do and then to see them achieving success in the industry upon graduation. Its nice to know that, as a teacher, you had some small part in that. Not all the work an animation artist takes on in a career is work we can feel proud of...but, I find teaching has always been a rewarding experience. It's become a vital part of my career cocktail. Its the lime in my gin and tonic. A small part, but one the makes a big contribution to the whole.

I never know what will touch a nerve in my SVA animation career class. So, I was very pleased when a healthy debate erupted based on the ""Desktop Dilemma"" section of Chapter 7 in my book, ""Your Career in Animation: How to Survive and Thrive."" Assuming you have the book (I can dream, can't I?), I'll give you a minute to look that section up. In short, it was a cautionary tale of how an animation artist could damage his reputation by adorning his wall space and desktop computer with swim suit models and scantily clad teen starlets.
Look at any studio's animation cubicles and offices and you'll find personal items such as posters, toys, family photos, doodles, and other decorations at most every workstation. The stuff we surround ourselves with projects an image. Its a public display of our tastes, humor, and personality. But, how much should one share at the workplace? Even when it comes to the creative workspaces in this industry?
In response to the ""Desktop Dilemma"" story above, one female class member explained that if she sees pictures in the workplace that objectify woman, it feels like a personal attack. It makes her feel as if she is being looked at as a sexual object around the office.
The particulars of office culture comes into play when trying to understand this complicated issue. A preschool series tends to have young children, mothers, child development specialists, and female network executives walking through the office on a regular basis. Its easy to understand why it would not be desirable to have anything potentially offensive on display.
One male student objected and felt that the images described in ""Desktop Dilemma"" were not offensive to him... and, besides, another studio in town that animates edgy adult swim and comedy central series' had much worse on their walls. The difference, I explained, was that the edgy studio was an independent company, set up to reflect the taste and personality of its owner. For some, that might be reason enough to not want to work there. Not everyone is the right fit for every situation. And, on the male students first point (he did not understand what was offensive about swimsuit pictures), I told him the issue wasn't his personal definition of what was offensive. Instead, the point is to be sensitive that somebody else ""might"" take offense.
I'm not sure I got this point across either. Later that night (after class), a trusted friend suggested that for men that didn't understand what could be offensive about female swimsuit pictures posted at the office,...maybe they would understand it in other terms that might be offensive to them. There's a long list of potentially offensive material that I wouldn't recommend displaying in the workplace: images that are racist, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, anti-Christian, homophobic, etc. Think of the what might offend you and understand that there are some women who might be offended by your sports illustrated swim suit calendar or copies of Maxim magazine.
The bottom line is that the office, desk, chairs, stapler, computers, and walls, are not your property. You are only keeping the seat warm for the length of time you are on a project. You are working in someone else's home in a highly collaborative process staffed by men and women of all kinds.
I tried one last time to reach this male student. I asked him, ""Is it worth the risk of harming your reputation to prove a point that you're entitled to express yourself no-matter-what the circumstances? Not quite sure if this was understood either, I asked, ""What are your goals on a job? Are you there to conduct a sociological experiment to determine what percent of a staff might be offended by your wall-hangings?...Or, are you there to be an animation artist working in harmony with the rest of the team?",<urn:uuid:af3f2529-c626-409a-8e68-50644b3a6d39>,CC-MAIN-2013-20,http://animondays.blogspot.com/2009_04_01_archive.html,2013-05-18T08:07:58Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz,en,0.981707513,4288,,,,,
